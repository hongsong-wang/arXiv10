We address this challenge with a vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes multimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM controller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs M-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified trajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we develop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool reasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of 11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via step-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA, MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating scalable and effective multimodal tool use.

However, the multimodal scaling property of this paradigm remains difficult to explore due to the separated training. In this paper, we focus on the native training of MLLMs in an end-to-end manner and systematically study its design space and scaling property under a practical setting, i.e., data constraint. Through careful study of various choices in MLLM, we obtain the optimal meta-architecture that best balances performance and training cost. After that, we further explore the scaling properties of the native MLLM and indicate the positively correlated scaling relationship between visual encoders and LLMs. Based on these findings, we propose a native MLLM called NaViL, combined with a simple and cost-effective recipe. Experimental results on 14 multimodal benchmarks confirm the competitive performance of NaViL against existing MLLMs. Besides that, our findings and results provide in-depth insights for the future study of native MLLMs.<br>

We study sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model families. We observe that apparent "forgetting" on held-out tasks after narrow fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. We trace this behavior to a measurable shift in the output token distribution, manifested through a simple counting-bias probe that co-varies with forgetting. Guided by this picture, we identify two simple, robust tuning recipes that learn strongly while limiting drift: (i) updating only the self-attention projection layers, and (ii) updating only the MLP Gate&Up while freezing the Down projection. Across models and tasks, these choices deliver strong target gains while largely preserving held-out performance. Code is available at https://github.com/jessemelpolio/LMM_CL<br>

Existing approaches for memory-persistent VLN face critical limitations: they lack effective memory access mechanisms, instead relying on entire memory incorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and predominantly store only environmental observations while neglecting navigation behavioral patterns that encode valuable decision-making strategies. We present Memoir, which employs imagination as a retrieval mechanism grounded by explicit memory: a world model imagines future navigation states as queries to selectively retrieve relevant environmental observations and behavioral histories. The approach comprises: 1) a language-conditioned world model that imagines future states serving dual purposes: encoding experiences for storage and generating retrieval queries; 2) Hybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral patterns to viewpoints, enabling hybrid retrieval; and 3) an experience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge through specialized encoders. Extensive evaluation across diverse memory-persistent VLN benchmarks with 10 distinctive testing scenarios demonstrates Memoir's effectiveness: significant improvements across all scenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over the best memory-persistent baseline, accompanied by 8.3x training speedup and 74% inference memory reduction. The results validate that predictive retrieval of both environmental and behavioral memories enables more effective navigation, with analysis indicating substantial headroom (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for this imagination-guided paradigm.

We identify that this limitation stems from a critical gap: existing methods attempt to learn spatial reasoning directly without establishing the hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding. To address this challenge, we present a comprehensive methodology for building spatial intelligence progressively. We introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a multimodal dataset containing 26,610 samples spanning object localization, single image, multi-view, and video spatial reasoning tasks, constructed through a standardized pipeline that ensures systematic coverage across modalities. Building on this dataset, we design a three-stage progressive training framework that (1) establishes spatial perception through object localization, (2) develops spatial understanding through multi-dimensional spatial tasks, and (3) strengthens complex reasoning via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. This approach yields SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning benchmarks, with 23.4% average improvement over the base model, surpassing GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%. Notably, SpatialLadder maintains strong generalization with 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks, demonstrating that progressive training from perception to reasoning is essential for robust spatial intelligence.<br>

It involves navigating diverse knowledge spaces and reasoning over complex, multi-step dependencies, which presents substantial challenges for agentic systems. To address this, we propose FlowSearch, a multi-agent framework that actively constructs and evolves a dynamic structured knowledge flow to drive subtask execution and reasoning. FlowSearch is capable of strategically planning and expanding the knowledge flow to enable parallel exploration and hierarchical task decomposition, while also adjusting the knowledge flow in real time based on feedback from intermediate reasoning outcomes and insights. FlowSearch achieves state-of-the-art performance on both general and scientific benchmarks, including GAIA, HLE, GPQA and TRQA, demonstrating its effectiveness in multi-disciplinary research scenarios and its potential to advance scientific discovery.

However, in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) scenarios such as AutoML and Kaggle competitions, achieving high performance depends heavily on expert intervention and repeated adjustments rather than simply generating correct code. When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack fine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or tree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical links. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share information across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoMLGen, an LLM-based coding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior guidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. MCGS retains the tree-guided exploration of MCTS while embedding a graph structure into the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical trajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion to support both self-evolution and collaborative learning. Combined with fine-grained operator sets, this design improves stability and accelerates convergence. Evaluation on the MLE-Bench shows that AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous dimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under a 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime).

However, challenges such as training data scarcity and imbalance continue to hinder their development. Inspired by complex dynamic system theories, we design a series-symbol data generation mechanism, enabling the unrestricted creation of high-quality time series data paired with corresponding symbolic expressions. To leverage series-symbol data pairs with strong correlations, we develop \texttt{SymTime}, a pre-trained foundation model for enhancing time series representation using symbolic information. \texttt{SymTime} demonstrates competitive performance across five major TSA tasks when fine-tunes with downstream tasks, rivaling foundation models pre-trained on real-world datasets.

In particular, GRPO demands a stochastic policy, yet the most cost-effective diffusion samplers are based on deterministic ODEs. Recent work addresses this issue by using inefficient SDE-based samplers to induce stochasticity, but this reliance on model-agnostic Gaussian noise leads to slow convergence. To resolve this conflict, we propose Direct Group Preference Optimization (DGPO), a new online RL algorithm that dispenses with the policy-gradient framework entirely. DGPO learns directly from group-level preferences, which utilize relative information of samples within groups. This design eliminates the need for inefficient stochastic policies, unlocking the use of efficient deterministic ODE samplers and faster training. Extensive results show that DGPO trains around 20 times faster than existing state-of-the-art methods and achieves superior performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain reward metrics.

Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based LoRA variants show promise in mitigating intra-task correlations in single-task instruction tuning, they introduce additional router parameters and remain ineffective in multi-task model merging where inter-task interference arises. Inspired by the fly olfactory circuit, we propose FlyLoRA, an implicit MoE-based LoRA variant that introduces: (1) rank-wise expert activation in the up-projection matrix, and (2) an implicit router that unifies expert routing and down-projection, where a frozen sparse random projection matrix replaces the traditional dense trainable version. This design resolves the trade-off between intra-task decorrelation and computational efficiency by eliminating the need for an explicit router, while inherently mitigating inter-task interference due to the orthogonality property of random matrices. Extensive experiments across four domains -- general knowledge understanding, scientific question answering, mathematical reasoning, and code generation -- demonstrate consistent performance improvements over existing methods. Beyond empirical gains, FlyLoRA highlights how biological structures can inspire innovations in AI technologies. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/FlyLoRA.<br>

To address these limitations, we propose QAgent, a unified agentic RAG framework that employs a search agent for adaptive retrieval. This agent optimizes its understanding of the query through interactive reasoning and retrieval. To facilitate real-world application, we focus on modular search agent for query understanding that are plug-and-play in complex systems. Secifically, the agent follows a multi-step decision process trained with RL to maximize retrieval quality and support accurate downstream answers. We further analyze the strengths and weaknesses of end-to-end RL and propose a strategy that focuses on effective retrieval, thereby enhancing generalization in LLM applications.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach empirically and provide a theoretical result: the gauge freedom induced by scaling symmetries is strictly smaller in convolutional neural networks than in multi-layer perceptrons. This insight helps explain the performance differences observed between architectures in both our work and that of Kalogeropoulos et al. (2024).

However, LLMs exhibit cultural bias and limited awareness of underrepresented cultures, while the mechanisms underlying their cultural understanding remain underexplored. To fill this gap, we conduct a neuron-level analysis to identify neurons that drive cultural behavior, introducing a gradient-based scoring method with additional filtering for precise refinement. We identify both culture-general neurons contributing to cultural understanding regardless of cultures, and culture-specific neurons tied to an individual culture. These neurons account for less than 1% of all neurons and are concentrated in shallow to middle MLP layers. We validate their role by showing that suppressing them substantially degrades performance on cultural benchmarks (by up to 30%), while performance on general natural language understanding (NLU) benchmarks remains largely unaffected. Moreover, we show that culture-specific neurons support knowledge of not only the target culture, but also related cultures. Finally, we demonstrate that training on NLU benchmarks can diminish models' cultural understanding when we update modules containing many culture-general neurons. These findings provide insights into the internal mechanisms of LLMs and offer practical guidance for model training and engineering. Our code is available at https://github.com/ynklab/CULNIG<br>

Previous arts failed to address both of them, always with either of them to be remedied. Such facts, as we observed, stem from the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that encode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text prompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \textbf{NTN-Diff}, for text-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across masked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band, while preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row. Based on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the mid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process. As observed, the stable mid-frequency band is progressively denoised to be semantically aligned during text-guided denoising process, which, meanwhile, serves as the guidance to the null-text denoising process to denoise low-frequency band for the masked regions, followed by a subsequent text-guided denoising process at late stage, to achieve the semantics consistency for mid-and-low frequency bands across masked and unmasked regions, while preserve the unmasked regions. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of NTN-Diff over the state-of-the-art diffusion models to text-guided diffusion models.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a crucial component for dLLMs to achieve comparable performance with AR-LLMs on important tasks, such as reasoning. However, RL algorithms that are well-suited for dLLMs' unique characteristics have yet to be developed. This paper proposes Distribution Matching Policy Optimization (DMPO), a principled and theoretically grounded RL fine-tuning method specifically designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of dLLMs by matching the dLLM policy distribution to the optimal, reward-tilted one through cross-entropy optimization. We identify a key challenge in the implementation with a small training batch size and propose several effective solutions through a novel weight baseline subtraction technique. DMPO exhibits superior performance on multiple reasoning benchmarks without supervised fine-tuning, with an accuracy improvement of up to $42.9\%$ over previously SOTA baselines and $55.8\%$ over the base model, underscoring the effectiveness of the distribution matching framework.

Despite the availability of numerous public datasets on COVID-19, some reaching volumes of up to 100 billion data points, challenges persist regarding the availability of labeled data and the presence of coarse-grained or inappropriate sentiment labels. In this paper, we introduce SenWave, a novel fine-grained multi-language sentiment analysis dataset specifically designed for analyzing COVID-19 tweets, featuring ten sentiment categories across five languages. The dataset comprises 10,000 annotated tweets each in English and Arabic, along with 30,000 translated tweets in Spanish, French, and Italian, derived from English tweets. Additionally, it includes over 105 million unlabeled tweets collected during various COVID-19 waves. To enable accurate fine-grained sentiment classification, we fine-tuned pre-trained transformer-based language models using the labeled tweets. Our study provides an in-depth analysis of the evolving emotional landscape across languages, countries, and topics, revealing significant insights over time. Furthermore, we assess the compatibility of our dataset with ChatGPT, demonstrating its robustness and versatility in various applications. Our dataset and accompanying code are publicly accessible on the repository\footnote{https://github.com/gitdevqiang/SenWave}.

Non-Autoregressive (NAR) models offer holistic, bidirectional representations but face challenges with generative coherence and scalability. To transcend this, we propose a hybrid framework enhancing AR generation by dynamically integrating rich contextual information from non-autoregressive mechanisms. Our approach couples a shared input encoder with two decoders: a non-autoregressive one learning latent bidirectional biological features, and an AR decoder synthesizing the biological sequence by leveraging these bidirectional features. A novel cross-decoder attention module enables the AR decoder to iteratively query and integrate these bidirectional features, enriching its predictions. This synergy is cultivated via a tailored training strategy with importance annealing for balanced objectives and cross-decoder gradient blocking for stable, focused learning. Evaluations on a demanding nine-species benchmark of de novo peptide sequencing show that our model substantially surpasses AR and NAR baselines. It uniquely harmonizes AR stability with NAR contextual awareness, delivering robust, superior performance on diverse downstream data. This research advances biological sequence modeling techniques and contributes a novel architectural paradigm for augmenting AR models with enhanced bidirectional understanding for complex sequence generation.

In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of variable-rate texture compression on modern GPUs using the JPEG format, and how it compares to the GPU-friendly fixed-rate compression approaches BC1 and ASTC. Using a deferred rendering pipeline, we are able to identify the subset of blocks that are needed for a given frame, decode these, and colorize the framebuffer's pixels. Despite the additional $\sim$0.17 bit per pixel that we require for our approach, JPEG maintains significantly better quality and compression rates compared to BC1, and depending on the type of image, outperforms or competes with ASTC. The JPEG rendering pipeline increases rendering duration by less than 0.3 ms on an RTX 4090, demonstrating that sophisticated variable-rate compression schemes are feasible on modern GPUs, even in VR.

This approach plays a vital role in aligning LLMs with human judgments, providing accurate and reliable assessments. However, LLM-based judgment models often exhibit judgment preference bias during the evaluation phase, tending to favor responses generated by themselves, undermining the reliability of their judgments. This paper introduces the Group-Based Polling Optimization (Genii), an unsupervised multi-agent collaborative optimization framework that mitigates the inherent judgment preference bias of judgment models. Specifically, Genii integrates various LLM-based judgment models into a multi-agent system and simulates the interactive client-server polling mechanism to optimize each client agent unsupervisedly. Our experiments demonstrate that Genii outperforms supervised models trained on annotated judgment data, while requiring no human-labeled annotations. Genii consistently improves performance across different client agents during the polling, even when weaker models act as server agents. Further analysis reveals that Genii effectively mitigates judgment preference bias of LLM-based judgment models, demonstrating its effectiveness.

However, detecting such videos faces significant challenges in modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal dynamics and identifying subtle anomalies that violate physical laws. In this paper, we propose a physics-driven AI-generated video detection paradigm based on probability flow conservation principles. Specifically, we propose a statistic called Normalized Spatiotemporal Gradient (NSG), which quantifies the ratio of spatial probability gradients to temporal density changes, explicitly capturing deviations from natural video dynamics. Leveraging pre-trained diffusion models, we develop an NSG estimator through spatial gradients approximation and motion-aware temporal modeling without complex motion decomposition while preserving physical constraints. Building on this, we propose an NSG-based video detection method (NSG-VD) that computes the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between NSG features of the test and real videos as a detection metric. Last, we derive an upper bound of NSG feature distances between real and generated videos, proving that generated videos exhibit amplified discrepancies due to distributional shifts. Extensive experiments confirm that NSG-VD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 16.00% in Recall and 10.75% in F1-Score, validating the superior performance of NSG-VD.

While this real-world threat is increasingly prevalent, existing academic evaluations and benchmarks for detecting deepfake forgery often fall short to achieve effective application for their lack of specificity, limited deepfake diversity, restricted manipulation techniques.To address these limitations, we introduce RedFace (Real-world-oriented Deepfake Face), a specialized facial deepfake dataset, comprising over 60,000 forged images and 1,000 manipulated videos derived from authentic facial features, to bridge the gap between academic evaluations and real-world necessity. Unlike prior benchmarks, which typically rely on academic methods to generate deepfakes, RedFace utilizes 9 commercial online platforms to integrate the latest deepfake technologies found "in the wild", effectively simulating real-world black-box scenarios.Moreover, RedFace's deepfakes are synthesized using bespoke algorithms, allowing it to capture diverse and evolving methods used by real-world deepfake creators. Extensive experimental results on RedFace (including cross-domain, intra-domain, and real-world social network dissemination simulations) verify the limited practicality of existing deepfake detection schemes against real-world applications.

However, these responses are often excessively long, containing redundant reasoning steps that inflate inference cost and reduce usability. Controlling the length of generated reasoning without sacrificing accuracy remains an open challenge. Through a systematic empirical analysis, we reveal a consistent positive correlation between model entropy and response length at different reasoning stages across diverse LRMs: the thinking phase exhibits higher entropy, reflecting exploratory behavior of longer responses, while the final answer phase shows lower entropy, indicating a more deterministic solution.This observation suggests that entropy at different reasoning stages can serve as a control knob for balancing conciseness and performance. Based on this insight, this paper introduces Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR), a reward mechanism that incorporating phase-dependent entropy into the reward design. Instead of treating all tokens uniformly, PEAR penalize excessive entropy during the thinking phase and allowing moderate exploration at the final answer phase, which encourages models to generate concise reasoning traces that retain sufficient flexibility to solve the task correctly. This enables adaptive control of response length without relying on explicit length targets or rigid truncation rules. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that PEAR consistently reduces response length while sustaining competitive accuracy across model scales. In addition, PEAR demonstrates strong out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness beyond the training distribution. Our code is available at: https://github.com/iNLP-Lab/PEAR.<br>

However, the absence of explicit depth information often makes it difficult for camera-based perception systems, e.g., 3D object detection, to generate accurate predictions. To alleviate the ambiguity in depth estimation, we propose RayFusion, a ray-based fusion method for collaborative visual perception. Using ray occupancy information from collaborators, RayFusion reduces redundancy and false positive predictions along camera rays, enhancing the detection performance of purely camera-based collaborative perception systems. Comprehensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, substantially advancing the performance of collaborative visual perception.

On the other hand, event-based cameras have gained popularity in the vision research community for their low latency and low energy advantages that make them ideal for applications where those resources are constrained like portable electronics and mobile robots. In this work we propose a Graph Neural Network, GraphEnet, that leverages the sparse nature of event camera output, with an intermediate line based event representation, to estimate 2D Human Pose of a single person at a high frequency. The architecture incorporates a novel offset vector learning paradigm with confidence based pooling to estimate the human pose.

However, SFT is resource-intensive, relying on large curated datasets, rejection-sampled demonstrations, and uniform optimization across all tokens, even though only a fraction carry meaningful learning value. In this work, we explore a counterintuitive idea: can smaller language models (SLMs) teach larger language models (LLMs) by revealing high-value reasoning moments that reflect the latter's unique strength? We propose LightReasoner, a novel framework that leverages the behavioral divergence between a stronger expert model (LLM) and a weaker amateur model (SLM). LightReasoner operates in two stages: (1) a sampling stage that pinpoints critical reasoning moments and constructs supervision examples capturing the expert's advantage through expert-amateur contrast, and (2) a fine-tuning stage that aligns the expert model with these distilled examples, amplifying its reasoning strengths. Across seven mathematical benchmarks, LightReasoner improves accuracy by up to 28.1%, while reducing time consumption by 90%, sampled problems by 80%, and tuned token usage by 99%, all without relying on ground-truth labels. By turning weaker SLMs into effective teaching signals, LightReasoner offers a scalable and resource-efficient approach for advancing LLM reasoning.

Benchmarks such as LMMs-Eval and HELM demand thousands of GPU hours per model. Costly evaluation reduces inclusivity, slows the cycle of innovation, and worsens environmental impact. The typical approach follows two steps. First, select an anchor subset of data. Second, train a mapping from the accuracy on this subset to the final test result. The drawback is that anchor selection depends on clustering, which can be complex and sensitive to design choices. We argue that promoting diversity among samples is not essential; what matters is to select samples that $\textit{maximise diversity in model responses}$. Our method, $\textbf{Diversifying Sample Condensation (DISCO)}$, selects the top-k samples with the greatest model disagreements. This uses greedy, sample-wise statistics rather than global clustering. The approach is conceptually simpler. From a theoretical view, inter-model disagreement provides an information-theoretically optimal rule for such greedy selection. $\textbf{DISCO}$ shows empirical gains over prior methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in performance prediction across MMLU, Hellaswag, Winogrande, and ARC.

However, existing models still struggle with questions that admit multiple valid answers. Standard QA benchmarks, which typically assume a single gold answer, overlook this reality and thus produce inappropriate training signals. Existing attempts to handle ambiguity often rely on costly manual annotation, which is difficult to scale to multi-hop datasets such as HotpotQA and MuSiQue. In this paper, we present A$^2$Search, an annotation-free, end-to-end training framework to recognize and handle ambiguity. At its core is an automated pipeline that detects ambiguous questions and gathers alternative answers via trajectory sampling and evidence verification. The model is then optimized with RL using a carefully designed $\mathrm{AnsF1}$ reward, which naturally accommodates multiple answers. Experiments on eight open-domain QA benchmarks demonstrate that A$^2$Search achieves new state-of-the-art performance. With only a single rollout, A$^2$Search-7B yields an average $\mathrm{AnsF1}@1$ score of $48.4\%$ across four multi-hop benchmarks, outperforming all strong baselines, including the substantially larger ReSearch-32B ($46.2\%$). Extensive analyses further show that A$^2$Search resolves ambiguity and generalizes across benchmarks, highlighting that embracing ambiguity is essential for building more reliable QA systems.

However, existing methods fail to fully exploit the complementary information embedded in both temporal and source dimensions. For example, Multi-Image Super-Resolution (MISR) enhances reconstruction quality by leveraging temporal complementarity across multiple observations, yet the limited fine-grained texture details in input images constrain its performance. Conversely, pansharpening integrates multi-source images by injecting high-frequency spatial information from panchromatic data, but typically relies on pre-interpolated low-resolution inputs and assumes noise-free alignment, making it highly sensitive to noise and misregistration. To address these issues, we propose SatFusion: A Unified Framework for Enhancing Satellite IoT Images via Multi-Temporal and Multi-Source Data Fusion. Specifically, SatFusion first employs a Multi-Temporal Image Fusion (MTIF) module to achieve deep feature alignment with the panchromatic image. Then, a Multi-Source Image Fusion (MSIF) module injects fine-grained texture information from the panchromatic data. Finally, a Fusion Composition module adaptively integrates the complementary advantages of both modalities while dynamically refining spectral consistency, supervised by a weighted combination of multiple loss functions. Extensive experiments on the WorldStrat, WV3, QB, and GF2 datasets demonstrate that SatFusion significantly improves fusion quality, robustness under challenging conditions, and generalizability to real-world Sat-IoT scenarios.

Despite their remarkable capabilities, LLMs often exhibit uneven performance across language families and specialized domains.

To address these gaps, we introduce Translation Tangles, a unified framework and dataset for evaluating the translation quality and fairness of open-source LLMs. Our approach benchmarks 24 bidirectional language pairs across multiple domains using different metrics.

To address this gap, we introduce DeepResearch-ReportEval, a comprehensive framework designed to assess DeepResearch systems through their most representative outputs: research reports. Our approach systematically measures three dimensions: quality, redundancy, and factuality, using an innovative LLM-as-a-Judge methodology achieving strong expert concordance. We contribute a standardized benchmark of 100 curated queries spanning 12 real-world categories, enabling systematic capability comparison.

To address this, we present ACMID: a dataset for MSS generated through web crawling of extensive raw data, followed by automatic cleaning via an instrument classifier built on a pre-trained audio encoder that filters and aggregates clean segments of target instruments from the crawled tracks, resulting in the refined ACMID-Cleaned dataset. Leveraging abundant data, we expand the conventional classification from 4-stem (Vocal/Bass/Drums/Others) to 7-stem (Piano/Drums/Bass/Acoustic Guitar/Electric Guitar/Strings/Wind-Brass), enabling high granularity MSS systems. Experiments on SOTA MSS model demonstrates two key results: (i) MSS model trained with ACMID-Cleaned achieved a 2.39dB improvement in SDR performance compared to that with ACMID-Uncleaned, demostrating the effectiveness of our data cleaning procedure; (ii) incorporating ACMID-Cleaned to training enhances MSS model's average performance by 1.16dB, confirming the value of our dataset.

However, creating them from sparse views remains a challenge due to geometric ambiguity. Existing methods often treat semantics as a passive feature painted on an already-formed, and potentially flawed, geometry. We posit that for robust sparse-view reconstruction, semantic understanding instead be an active, guiding force. This paper introduces AlignGS, a novel framework that actualizes this vision by pioneering a synergistic, end-to-end optimization of geometry and semantics. Our method distills rich priors from 2D foundation models and uses them to directly regularize the 3D representation through a set of novel semantic-to-geometry guidance mechanisms, including depth consistency and multi-faceted normal regularization. Extensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and produces reconstructions with superior geometric accuracy. The results validate that leveraging semantic priors as a geometric regularizer leads to more coherent and complete 3D models from limited input views.

Our approach combines an I3D-based feature extraction module with a specialized feature transformation network and an audio generation pipeline, utilizing a novel Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) algorithm for the temporal detection of signs in non-grammatic continuous sequences.

We observe that existing defense mechanisms fail to generalize to harmful queries disguised by unseen attack templates, despite LLMs being capable of distinguishing disguised harmful queries in the embedding space. Based on these insights, we propose a two-stage defense approach: (i) pre-generation defense that detects harmful queries before response generation begins, and (ii) mid-generation defense that monitors partial responses during generation to prevent outputting more harmful content. Our MetaDefense trains the LLM to predict the harmfulness of both queries and partial responses using specialized prompts, enabling early termination of potentially harmful interactions. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures (LLaMA-2-7B, Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct, and LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct) demonstrate that MetaDefense significantly outperforms existing defense mechanisms, achieving robust defense against harmful queries with seen and unseen attack templates while maintaining competitive performance on benign tasks.

At the heart of this shift is multi-vehicle dynamic navigation, which requires simultaneously routing large fleets under evolving traffic conditions. Existing path search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to city-wide networks, often failing to capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and coupled dynamics of urban traffic. To address these challenges, we propose CityNav, a hierarchical, LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle navigation. CityNav integrates a global traffic allocation agent, which coordinates strategic traffic flow distribution across regions, with local navigation agents that generate locally adaptive routes aligned with global directives. To enable effective cooperation, we introduce a cooperative reasoning optimization mechanism, in which agents are jointly trained with a dual-reward structure: individual rewards promote per-vehicle efficiency, while shared rewards encourage network-wide coordination and congestion reduction. Extensive experiments on four real-world road networks of varying scales (up to 1.6 million roads and 430,000 intersections) and traffic datasets demonstrate that CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based baselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation. Our results highlight the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, adaptive, and cooperative city-wide traffic navigation, providing a foundation for intelligent, large-scale vehicle routing in complex urban environments.

However, existing methods focus on pixel-level accuracy, causing oversmoothed room corners and noise sensitivity. In this paper, we propose a depth estimation framework based on room geometry constraints, which extracts room geometry information through layout prediction and integrates those information into the depth estimation process through background segmentation mechanism. At the model level, our framework comprises a shared feature encoder followed by task-specific decoders for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. The shared encoder extracts multi-scale features, which are subsequently processed by individual decoders to generate initial predictions: a depth map, a room layout map, and a background segmentation map. Furthermore, our framework incorporates two strategies: a room geometry-based background depth resolving strategy and a background-segmentation-guided fusion mechanism. The proposed room-geometry-based background depth resolving strategy leverages the room layout and the depth decoder's output to generate the corresponding background depth map. Then, a background-segmentation-guided fusion strategy derives fusion weights for the background and coarse depth maps from the segmentation decoder's predictions. Extensive experimental results on the Stanford2D3D, Matterport3D and Structured3D datasets show that our proposed methods can achieve significantly superior performance than current open-source methods.

Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks mainly focus on egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video context, or geographic perspective reasoning with graphics context (eg. a map), thus fail to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video and graphics context, which is important for areas like traffic management and emergency response. To address the gaps, we introduce Geo-Temporal Reasoning benchmark (GTR-Bench), a novel challenge for geographic temporal reasoning of moving targets in a large-scale camera network. GTR-Bench is more challenging as it requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and inference over spatial-temporal regions that are unobserved by any video context. Evaluations of more than 10 popular VLMs on GTR-Bench demonstrate that even the best proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%), significantly lags behind human performance (78.61%) on geo-temporal reasoning. Moreover, our comprehensive analysis on GTR-Bench reveals three primary deficiencies of current models for geo-temporal reasoning. (1) VLMs' reasoning is impaired by an imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context. (2) VLMs are weak in temporal forecasting, which leads to worse performance on temporal-emphasized tasks than on spatial-emphasized tasks. (3) VLMs lack the proficiency to comprehend or align the map data with multi-view video inputs. We believe GTR-Bench offers valuable insights and opens up new opportunities for research and applications in spatial-temporal intelligence. Benchmark and code will be released at https://github.com/X-Luffy/GTR-Bench.<br>

Extending the inference limits of smaller models has become a prominent research focus. However, algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffer from a clear drawback: the upper bound of a model's rollout responses is entirely determined by the model itself, preventing the acquisition of knowledge from samples that are either all incorrect or all correct. In this paper, we introduce Group Contrastive Policy Optimization (GCPO), a method that incorporates external standard reference answers. When the model cannot solve a problem, the reference answer supplies the correct response, steering the model toward an unequivocally accurate update direction. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it improves training efficiency by fully utilizing every sample; (2) it enables the model to emulate the problem solving strategy of the reference answer during training, thereby enhancing generalization in reasoning. GCPO achieves outstanding results across multiple benchmark datasets, yielding substantial improvements over the baseline model. Our code is available at: https://github.com/AchoWu/GCPO.<br>

The study focused on applying UNet models for brain tumor segmentation and using the XAI techniques of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and attention-based visualization to enhance the understanding of these models. Three deep learning models - UNet, Residual UNet (ResUNet), and Attention UNet (AttUNet) - were evaluated to identify the best-performing model. XAI was employed with the aims of clarifying model decisions and increasing physicians' trust in these models. We compared the performance of two UNet variants (ResUNet and AttUNet) with the conventional UNet in segmenting brain tumors from the BraTS2020 public dataset and analyzed model predictions with Grad-CAM and attention-based visualization. Using the latest computer hardware, we trained and validated each model using the Adam optimizer and assessed their performance with respect to: (i) training, validation, and inference times, (ii) segmentation similarity coefficients and loss functions, and (iii) classification performance. Notably, during the final testing phase, ResUNet outperformed the other models with respect to Dice and Jaccard similarity scores, as well as accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. Grad-CAM provided visuospatial insights into the tumor subregions each UNet model focused on while attention-based visualization provided valuable insights into the working mechanisms of AttUNet's attention modules. These results demonstrated ResUNet as the best-performing model and we conclude by recommending its use for automated brain tumor segmentation in future clinical assessments.

Recent advances in latent reasoning, where intermediate reasoning unfolds in continuous vector spaces, offer a more efficient alternative to explicit Chain-of-Thought, yet whether such latent models can similarly benefit from parallel TTS remains open, mainly due to the absence of sampling mechanisms in continuous space, and the lack of probabilistic signals for advanced trajectory aggregation. \ This work enables parallel TTS for latent reasoning models by addressing the above issues. For sampling, we introduce two uncertainty-inspired stochastic strategies: Monte Carlo Dropout and Additive Gaussian Noise. For aggregation, we design a Latent Reward Model (LatentRM) trained with step-wise contrastive objective to score and guide latent reasoning. Extensive experiments and visualization analyses show that both sampling strategies scale effectively with compute and exhibit distinct exploration dynamics, while LatentRM enables effective trajectory selection. Together, our explorations open a new direction for scalable inference in continuous spaces. Code released at https://github.com/YRYangang/LatentTTS.<br>

However, existing MKGC research underutilizes the multilingual capabilities of LLMs and ignores the shareability of cross-lingual knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel MKGC framework that leverages multilingual shared knowledge to significantly enhance performance through two components: Knowledge-level Grouped Mixture of Experts (KL-GMoE) and Iterative Entity Reranking (IER). KL-GMoE efficiently models shared knowledge, while IER significantly enhances its utilization. To evaluate our framework, we constructed a mKG dataset containing 5 languages and conducted comprehensive comparative experiments with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) MKGC method. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves improvements of 5.47%, 3.27%, and 1.01% in the Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@10 metrics, respectively, compared with SOTA MKGC method. Further experimental analysis revealed the properties of knowledge sharing in settings of unseen and unbalanced languages.

This shift unlocks a rich source of user textual history, presenting a profound opportunity for a deeper form of personalization. However, prevailing approaches offer only a shallow form of personalization, as they treat user history as a flat list of texts for retrieval and fail to model the rich temporal and semantic structures reflecting dynamic nature of user interests. In this work, we propose \textbf{MemWeaver}, a framework that weaves the user's entire textual history into a hierarchical memory to power deeply personalized generation. The core innovation of our memory lies in its ability to capture both the temporal evolution of interests and the semantic relationships between different activities. To achieve this, MemWeaver builds two complementary memory components that both integrate temporal and semantic information, but at different levels of abstraction: behavioral memory, which captures specific user actions, and cognitive memory, which represents long-term preferences. This dual-component memory serves as a unified representation of the user, allowing large language models (LLMs) to reason over both concrete behaviors and abstracted traits. Experiments on the Language Model Personalization (LaMP) benchmark validate the efficacy of MemWeaver. Our code is available\footnote{https://github.com/fishsure/MemWeaver}.<br>

While the predominant method for estimating the return distribution is by modeling it as a categorical distribution over discrete bins or estimating a finite number of quantiles, such approaches leave unanswered questions about the fine-grained structure of the return distribution and about how to distinguish states with high return uncertainty for decision-making. The key idea in this paper is to use modern, flexible flow-based models to estimate the full future return distributions and identify those states with high return variance. We do so by formulating a new flow-matching objective that generates probability density paths satisfying the distributional Bellman equation. Building upon the learned flow models, we estimate the return uncertainty of distinct states using a new flow derivative ODE. We additionally use this uncertainty information to prioritize learning a more accurate return estimation on certain transitions. We compare our method (Value Flows) with prior methods in the offline and online-to-online settings. Experiments on $37$ state-based and $25$ image-based benchmark tasks demonstrate that Value Flows achieves a $1.3\times$ improvement on average in success rates.

While Maximum Likelihood Estimation has traditionally served as the dominant training paradigm, recent work have highlighted its limitations, particularly in generalization and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting compared to Reinforcement Learning techniques, such as Policy Gradient methods. However, these approaches depend on explicit reward signals, which are often unavailable in practice, leaving open the fundamental problem of how to align generative models when only high-quality datasets are accessible. In this work, we address this challenge via a Bilevel Optimization framework, where the reward function is treated as the optimization variable of an outer-level problem, while a policy gradient objective defines the inner-level. We then conduct a theoretical analysis of this optimization problem in a tractable setting and extract insights that, as we demonstrate, generalize to applications such as tabular classification and model-based reinforcement learning.

The system is modular in that one first creates a target phonology for the language using an agentic approach that refines its output at each step with commentary feedback on its previous attempt. Next, a set of sentences is 'translated' from their English original into a morphosyntactic markup that reflects the word order and morphosyntactic feature specifications of the desired target language, with affixes represented as morphosyntactic feature bundles. From this translated corpus, a lexicon is constructed using the phonological model and the set of morphemes (stems and affixes) extracted from the 'translated' sentences. The system is then instructed to provide an orthography for the language, using an existing script such as Latin or Cyrillic. Finally, the system writes a brief grammatical handbook of the language. The system can also translate further sentences into the target language. Our goal is twofold. First, we hope that these tools will be fun to use for creating artificially constructed languages. Second, we are interested in exploring what LLMs 'know' about language-not what they know about any particular language or linguistic phenomenon, but how much they know about and understand language and linguistic concepts. As we shall see, there is a fairly wide gulf in capabilities both among different LLMs and among different linguistic specifications, with it being notably easier for systems to deal with more common patterns than rarer ones. An additional avenue that we explore is the application of our approach to translating from high-resource into low-resource languages. While the results so far are mostly negative, we provide some evidence that an improved version of the present system could afford some real gains in such tasks. https://github.com/SakanaAI/IASC<br>

While static graph ML enjoys mature frameworks like PyTorch Geometric and DGL, ML for temporal graphs (TG), networks that evolve over time, lacks comparable infrastructure. Existing TG libraries are often tailored to specific architectures, hindering support for diverse models in this rapidly evolving field. Additionally, the divide between continuous- and discrete-time dynamic graph methods (CTDG and DTDG) limits direct comparisons and idea transfer. To address these gaps, we introduce Temporal Graph Modelling (TGM), a research-oriented library for ML on temporal graphs, the first to unify CTDG and DTDG approaches. TGM offers first-class support for dynamic node features, time-granularity conversions, and native handling of link-, node-, and graph-level tasks. Empirically, TGM achieves an average 7.8x speedup across multiple models, datasets, and tasks compared to the widely used DyGLib, and an average 175x speedup on graph discretization relative to available implementations. Beyond efficiency, we show in our experiments how TGM unlocks entirely new research possibilities by enabling dynamic graph property prediction and time-driven training paradigms, opening the door to questions previously impractical to study.

Due to the limited availability of high-quality training samples and the high dimensionality of spectral data, HSI classification models are prone to overfitting and often face challenges in balancing accuracy and computational complexity. Furthermore, most of HSI classification models are monomodal, where it solely relies on spectral-spatial data to learn decision boundaries in the high dimensional embedding space. To address this, we propose a general-purpose Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion Network (S3FN) that uses contextual, class specific textual descriptions to complement the training of an HSI classification model. Specifically, S3FN leverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class label that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These descriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text encoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in turn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate our model on three diverse HSI benchmark datasets - Hyperspectral Wood, HyperspectralBlueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit and report significant performance boost. Our results highlight the synergy between textual semantics and spectral-spatial data, paving the way for further advancements in semantically augmented HSI classification models.

While recent semantic watermarking schemes improve robustness by embedding signals in latent or frequency representations, we show they remain vulnerable even under resource-constrained adversarial settings. We present D2RA, a training-free, single-image attack that removes or weakens watermarks without access to the underlying model. By projecting watermarked images onto natural priors across complementary representations, D2RA suppresses watermark signals while preserving visual fidelity. Experiments across diverse watermarking schemes demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces watermark detectability, revealing fundamental weaknesses in current designs.

Yet recent studies reveal that agents are not neutral: they are prone to identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, uncritically adopting a peer's view or stubbornly adhering to their own prior output, undermining the reliability of debate. In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins sycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First, we formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update process. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity markers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish "self" from "peer", which forces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias. Third, we define the Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled metric that measures how often an agent follows a peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple models, datasets and debate rounds confirm that identity bias is widespread, with sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need to "mask" identity to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather than source identity.

This property, compounded by modeling uncertainties and disturbances, complicates the control design process for trajectory tracking. In this work, we propose an adaptive control architecture for uncertain, nonlinear, underactuated systems with input constraints. Leveraging time-scale separation, we construct a reduced-order model where fast dynamics provide virtual inputs to the slower subsystem and use dynamic control allocation to select the optimal control inputs given the non-affine dynamics. To handle uncertainty, we introduce a state predictor-based adaptive law, and through singular perturbation theory and Lyapunov analysis, we prove stability and bounded tracking of reference trajectories. The proposed method is validated on a VTOL quadplane with nonlinear, state-dependent actuation, demonstrating its utility as a unified controller across various flight regimes, including cruise, landing transition, and hover.<br>

It also leads to substantial spatial misalignment between uLDCT and normal dose CT (NDCT) image pairs. This poses challenges for directly applying existing denoising networks trained on synthetic noise or aligned data. To address this core challenge in uLDCT denoising, this paper proposes an innovative denoising framework based on an Image Purification (IP) strategy. First, we construct a real clinical uLDCT lung dataset. Then, we propose an Image Purification strategy that generates structurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs, providing a high-quality data foundation for network training. Building upon this, we propose a Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model, which works synergistically with the IP strategy to excellently preserve the anatomical structure integrity of denoised images. Experiments on the real clinical dataset demonstrate that our IP strategy significantly enhances the performance of multiple mainstream denoising models on the uLDCT task. Notably, our proposed FFM model combined with the IP strategy achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in anatomical structure preservation. This study provides an effective solution to the data mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/MonkeyDadLufy/flow-matching.<br>

Unlike conventional MoEs that provide only point estimates, MoGU models each expert's output as a Gaussian distribution. This allows it to directly quantify both the forecast (the mean) and its inherent uncertainty (variance). MoGU's core innovation is its uncertainty-based gating mechanism, which replaces the traditional input-based gating network by using each expert's estimated variance to determine its contribution to the final prediction. Evaluated across diverse time series forecasting benchmarks, MoGU consistently outperforms single-expert models and traditional MoE setups. It also provides well-quantified, informative uncertainties that directly correlate with prediction errors, enhancing forecast reliability.

While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their ability to achieve competitive results across a wide range of NLP tasks, there is no prior evidence of how effective they are in the contextual lemmatization task. In this paper, we empirically investigate the capacity of the latest generation of LLMs to perform in-context lemmatization, comparing it to the traditional fully supervised approach. In particular, we consider the setting in which supervised training data is not available for a target domain or language, comparing (i) encoder-only supervised approaches, fine-tuned out-of-domain, and (ii) cross-lingual methods, against direct in-context lemma generation with LLMs. Our experimental investigation across 12 languages of different morphological complexity finds that, while encoders remain competitive in out-of-domain settings when fine-tuned on gold data, current LLMs reach state-of-the-art results for most languages by directly generating lemmas in-context without prior fine-tuning, provided just with a few examples.

We argue that haystack engineering is necessary to construct noisy long contexts that faithfully capture key real-world factors -- distraction from heterogeneous biased retrievers and cascading errors in agentic workflows -- to test models' long-context robustness. We instantiate it through HaystackCraft, a new NIAH benchmark built on the full English Wikipedia hyperlink network with multi-hop questions. HaystackCraft evaluates how heterogeneous retrieval strategies (e.g., sparse, dense, hybrid, and graph-based) affect distractor composition, haystack ordering, and downstream LLM performance. HaystackCraft further extends NIAH to dynamic, LLM-dependent settings that simulate agentic operations, where models refine queries, reflect on their past reasonings, and decide when to stop. Experiments with 15 long-context models show that (1) while stronger dense retrievers can introduce more challenging distractors, graph-based reranking simultaneously improves retrieval effectiveness and mitigates more harmful distractors; (2) in agentic tests, even advanced models like Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 suffer cascading failures from self-generated distractors or struggle to perform early stops. These results highlight persistent challenges in agentic long-context reasoning and establish HaystackCraft as a valuable testbed for future progress.<br>

Inspired by the Multi-Store Model in cognitive science, we introduce a memory framework of artificial neural networks. Our method maintains a sliding window of the Transformer's KV cache as lossless short-term memory, while a learnable module termed Artificial Hippocampus Network (AHN) recurrently compresses out-of-window information into a fixed-size compact long-term memory. To validate this framework, we instantiate AHNs using modern RNN-like architectures, including Mamba2, DeltaNet, and Gated DeltaNet. Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks LV-Eval and InfiniteBench demonstrate that AHN-augmented models consistently outperform sliding window baselines and achieve performance comparable or even superior to full-attention models, while substantially reducing computational and memory requirements. For instance, augmenting the Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct with AHNs reduces inference FLOPs by 40.5% and memory cache by 74.0%, while improving its average score on LV-Eval (128k sequence length) from 4.41 to 5.88.

However, existing methods often lack robustness against various transformations primarily including distortions, image regeneration, and adversarial perturbation, creating real-world challenges. In this work, we introduce SpecGuard, a novel watermarking approach for robust and invisible image watermarking. Unlike prior approaches, we embed the message inside hidden convolution layers by converting from the spatial domain to the frequency domain using spectral projection of a higher frequency band that is decomposed by wavelet projection. Spectral projection employs Fast Fourier Transform approximation to transform spatial data into the frequency domain efficiently. In the encoding phase, a strength factor enhances resilience against diverse attacks, including adversarial, geometric, and regeneration-based distortions, ensuring the preservation of copyrighted information. Meanwhile, the decoder leverages Parseval's theorem to effectively learn and extract the watermark pattern, enabling accurate retrieval under challenging transformations. We evaluate the proposed SpecGuard based on the embedded watermark's invisibility, capacity, and robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed SpecGuard outperforms the state-of-the-art models.

These models struggle with the quadratic cost of attention ($O(N^2)$) and with modeling long-range temporal dependencies. Existing audio benchmarks are built mostly from short clips and do not evaluate models in realistic long context settings. To address this gap, we introduce AudioMarathon, a benchmark designed to evaluate both understanding and inference efficiency on long-form audio. AudioMarathon provides a diverse set of tasks built upon three pillars: long-context audio inputs with durations ranging from 90.0 to 300.0 seconds, which correspond to encoded sequences of 2,250 to 7,500 audio tokens, respectively, full domain coverage across speech, sound, and music, and complex reasoning that requires multi-hop inference. We evaluate state-of-the-art LALMs and observe clear performance drops as audio length grows. We also study acceleration techniques and analyze the trade-offs of token pruning and KV cache eviction. The results show large gaps across current LALMs and highlight the need for better temporal reasoning and memory-efficient architectures.

Protein language models (pLMs) trained with masked language modeling (MLM) exhibit strong zero-shot fitness prediction; we provide a unifying view by interpreting natural evolution as implicit reward maximization and MLM as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), in which extant sequences act as expert demonstrations and pLM log-odds serve as fitness estimates. Building on this perspective, we introduce EvoIF, a lightweight model that integrates two complementary sources of evolutionary signal: (i) within-family profiles from retrieved homologs and (ii) cross-family structural-evolutionary constraints distilled from inverse folding logits. EvoIF fuses sequence-structure representations with these profiles via a compact transition block, yielding calibrated probabilities for log-odds scoring. On ProteinGym (217 mutational assays; >2.5M mutants), EvoIF and its MSA-enabled variant achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance while using only 0.15% of the training data and fewer parameters than recent large models. Ablations confirm that within-family and cross-family profiles are complementary, improving robustness across function types, MSA depths, taxa, and mutation depths.

While substantial works continue to rely on the popular but old benchmarks, their temporal misalignment with real-world facts and modern LLMs, and their effects on LLM factuality evaluation remain underexplored. Therefore, in this work, we present a systematic investigation of this issue by examining five popular factuality benchmarks and eight LLMs released across different years. An up-to-date fact retrieval pipeline and three metrics are tailored to quantify benchmark aging and its impact on LLM factuality evaluation. Experimental results and analysis illustrate that a considerable portion of samples in the widely used factuality benchmarks are outdated, leading to unreliable assessments of LLM factuality.

We introduce a simple and effective framework for pretraining SLMs that brings together three complementary ideas. First, we identify structurally sparse sub-network initializations that consistently outperform randomly initialized models of similar size under the same compute budget. Second, we use evolutionary search to automatically discover high-quality sub-network initializations, providing better starting points for pretraining. Third, we apply knowledge distillation from larger teacher models to speed up training and improve generalization. Together, these components make SLM pretraining substantially more efficient: our best model, discovered using evolutionary search and initialized with LLM weights, matches the validation perplexity of a comparable Pythia SLM while requiring 9.2x fewer pretraining tokens. We release all code and models at https://github.com/whittle-org/whittle/, offering a practical and reproducible path toward cost-efficient small language model development at scale.<br>

An evaluation of data scaling in Kinyarwanda and Kikuyu</a></div></span></div><div id='abs'>Abstract:<br><span id='abs'>The development of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems for low-resource African languages remains challenging due to limited transcribed speech data. While recent advances in large multilingual models like OpenAI's Whisper offer promising pathways for low-resource ASR development, critical questions persist regarding practical deployment requirements. This paper addresses two fundamental concerns for practitioners: determining the minimum data volumes needed for viable performance and characterizing the primary failure modes that emerge in production systems. We evaluate Whisper's performance through comprehensive experiments on two Bantu languages: systematic data scaling analysis on Kinyarwanda using training sets from 1 to 1,400 hours, and detailed error characterization on Kikuyu using 270 hours of training data. Our scaling experiments demonstrate that practical ASR performance (WER < 13\%) becomes achievable with as little as 50 hours of training data, with substantial improvements continuing through 200 hours (WER < 10\%). Complementing these volume-focused findings, our error analysis reveals that data quality issues, particularly noisy ground truth transcriptions, account for 38.6\% of high-error cases, indicating that careful data curation is as critical as data volume for robust system performance. These results provide actionable benchmarks and deployment guidance for teams developing ASR systems across similar low-resource language contexts.

Existing solutions, such as fine-tuning, are model-specific and require training, while prior automatic prompt optimization (APO) approaches typically lack systematic error analysis and refinement strategies, resulting in limited reliability and effectiveness. Meanwhile, test-time scaling methods operate on fixed prompts and on noise or sample numbers, limiting their interpretability and adaptability. To solve these, we introduce a flexible and efficient test-time prompt optimization strategy that operates directly on the input text. We propose a plug-and-play multi-agent system called GenPilot, integrating error analysis, clustering-based adaptive exploration, fine-grained verification, and a memory module for iterative optimization. Our approach is model-agnostic, interpretable, and well-suited for handling long and complex prompts. Simultaneously, we summarize the common patterns of errors and the refinement strategy, offering more experience and encouraging further exploration. Experiments on DPG-bench and Geneval with improvements of up to 16.9% and 5.7% demonstrate the strong capability of our methods in enhancing the text and image consistency and structural coherence of generated images, revealing the effectiveness of our test-time prompt optimization strategy.

Prior studies show that English-centric large language models map multilingual content into English-aligned representations at intermediate layers and then project them back into target-language token spaces in the final layer. From this observation, we hypothesize that this cross-lingual transition is governed by a small and sparse set of dimensions, which occur at consistent indices across the intermediate to final layers. Building on this insight, we introduce a simple, training-free method to identify and manipulate these dimensions, requiring only as few as 50 sentences of either parallel or monolingual data. Experiments on a multilingual generation control task reveal the interpretability of these dimensions, demonstrating that the interventions in these dimensions can switch the output language while preserving semantic content, and that it surpasses the performance of prior neuron-based approaches at a substantially lower cost.<br>

The effectiveness of these methods is typically assessed by measuring the accuracy drop on established benchmarks, comparing model performance before and after compression. However, these benchmarks are originally designed to assess the perception and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, rather than to evaluate compression techniques. As a result, directly applying them to visual token compression introduces a task mismatch. Strikingly, our investigation reveals that simple image downsampling consistently outperforms many advanced compression methods across multiple widely used benchmarks. Through extensive experiments, we make the following observations: (i) Current benchmarks are noisy for the visual token compression task. (ii) Down-sampling is able to serve as a data filter to evaluate the difficulty of samples in the visual token compression task. Motivated by these findings, we introduce VTC-Bench, an evaluation framework that incorporates a data filtering mechanism to denoise existing benchmarks, thereby enabling fairer and more accurate assessment of visual token compression methods.

However, their ability to generalize in low-data regimes, such as few-shot learning, remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we present the first structured benchmark for evaluating few-shot adaptation methods on RSVLMs. We conduct comprehensive experiments across ten remote sensing scene classification datasets, applying five widely used few-shot adaptation strategies to three state-of-the-art RSVLMs with varying backbones. Our findings reveal that models with similar zero-shot performance can exhibit markedly different behavior under few-shot adaptation, with some RSVLMs being inherently more amenable to such adaptation than others. The variability of performance and the absence of a clear winner among existing methods highlight the need for the development of more robust methods for few-shot adaptation tailored to RS. To facilitate future research, we provide a reproducible benchmarking framework and open-source code to systematically evaluate RSVLMs under few-shot conditions.

Federated learning (FL) is a training paradigm that overcomes these issues, though its effectiveness may be reduced when dealing with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. This study simulates non-IID conditions by applying different MRI intensity normalization techniques to separate data subsets, reflecting a common cause of heterogeneity. These subsets are then used for training and testing models for brain tumor segmentation. The findings provide insights into the influence of the MRI intensity normalization methods on segmentation models, both training and inference. Notably, the FL methods demonstrated resilience to inconsistently normalized data across clients, achieving the 3D Dice score of 92%, which is comparable to a centralized model (trained using all data). These results indicate that FL is a solution to effectively train high-performing models without violating data privacy, a crucial concern in medical applications.

However, existing open-source implementations suffer from quality-speed trade-offs that impede their practical deployment. Conservative sampling strategies typically decode only the most confident token per step to ensure quality (i.e., greedy decoding), at the cost of inference efficiency due to repeated redundant refinement iterations--a phenomenon we term delayed decoding. Through systematic analysis of dLLM decoding dynamics, we characterize this delayed decoding behavior and propose a training-free adaptive parallel decoding strategy, named LocalLeap, to address these inefficiencies. LocalLeap is built on two fundamental empirical principles: local determinism propagation centered on high-confidence anchors and progressive spatial consistency decay. By applying these principles, LocalLeap identifies anchors and performs localized relaxed parallel decoding within bounded neighborhoods, achieving substantial inference step reduction through early commitment of already-determined tokens without compromising output quality. Comprehensive evaluation on various benchmarks demonstrates that LocalLeap achieves 6.94$\times$ throughput improvements and reduces decoding steps to just 14.2\% of the original requirement, achieving these gains with negligible performance impact.

Using SpeechBrain wav2vec2-base model fine-tuned on IEMOCAP as the encoder, we compare two HPO strategies, Gaussian Process Bayesian Optimisation (GP-BO) and Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE), under an identical four-dimensional search space and 15-trial budget, with balanced class accuracy (BCA) on the German EmoDB corpus as the objective. All experiments run on 8 CPU cores with 32 GB RAM. GP-BO achieves 0.96 BCA in 11 minutes, and TPE (Hyperopt implementation) attains 0.97 in 15 minutes. In contrast, grid search requires 143 trials and 1,680 minutes to exceed 0.9 BCA, and the best AutoSpeech 2020 baseline reports only 0.85 in 30 minutes on GPU. For cross-lingual generalisation, an EmoDB-trained HPO-tuned model improves zero-shot accuracy by 0.25 on CREMA-D and 0.26 on RAVDESS.

We present Search-R3, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by adapting LLMs to generate search embeddings as a direct output of their reasoning process. Our approach exploits LLMs' chain-of-thought capabilities, allowing them to produce more effective embeddings by reasoning step-by-step through complex semantic analyses. We implement this through three complementary mechanisms. (1) a supervised learning stage enables the model's ability to produce quality embeddings, (2) a reinforcement learning (RL) methodology that optimizes embedding generation alongside reasoning, and (3) a specialized RL environment that efficiently handles evolving embedding representations without requiring complete corpus re-encoding at each training iteration. Our extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Search-R3 significantly outperforms prior methods by unifying the reasoning and embedding generation processes. This integrated post-training approach represents a substantial advancement in handling complex knowledge-intensive tasks that require both sophisticated reasoning and effective information retrieval.

Despite its widespread adoption, there is still no comprehensive benchmark to systematically evaluate their performance and utility, largely because of insufficient statistical validation and limited consideration of efficiency and generalization across diverse datasets. To bridge this gap, we present U-Bench, the first large-scale, statistically rigorous benchmark that evaluates 100 U-Net variants across 28 datasets and 10 imaging modalities. Our contributions are threefold: (1) Comprehensive Evaluation: U-Bench evaluates models along three key dimensions: statistical robustness, zero-shot generalization, and computational efficiency. We introduce a novel metric, U-Score, which jointly captures the performance-efficiency trade-off, offering a deployment-oriented perspective on model progress. (2) Systematic Analysis and Model Selection Guidance: We summarize key findings from the large-scale evaluation and systematically analyze the impact of dataset characteristics and architectural paradigms on model performance. Based on these insights, we propose a model advisor agent to guide researchers in selecting the most suitable models for specific datasets and tasks. (3) Public Availability: We provide all code, models, protocols, and weights, enabling the community to reproduce our results and extend the benchmark with future methods. In summary, U-Bench not only exposes gaps in previous evaluations but also establishes a foundation for fair, reproducible, and practically relevant benchmarking in the next decade of U-Net-based segmentation models.

Existing work leverages 2D and 3D modalities of molecular information for pre-training, aiming to capture comprehensive structural and geometric insights. However, these methods require paired 2D and 3D molecular data to train the model effectively and prevent it from collapsing into a single modality, posing limitations in scenarios where a certain modality is unavailable or computationally expensive to generate. To overcome this limitation, we propose FlexMol, a flexible molecule pre-training framework that learns unified molecular representations while supporting single-modality input. Specifically, inspired by the unified structure in vision-language models, our approach employs separate models for 2D and 3D molecular data, leverages parameter sharing to improve computational efficiency, and utilizes a decoder to generate features for the missing modality. This enables a multistage continuous learning process where both modalities contribute collaboratively during training, while ensuring robustness when only one modality is available during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexMol achieves superior performance across a wide range of molecular property prediction tasks, and we also empirically demonstrate its effectiveness with incomplete data.

In this work, we introduce Native Hybrid Attention (NHA), a novel hybrid architecture of linear and full attention that integrates both intra \& inter-layer hybridization into a unified layer design. NHA maintains long-term context in key-value slots updated by a linear RNN, and augments them with short-term tokens from a sliding window. A single \texttt{softmax attention} operation is then applied over all keys and values, enabling per-token and per-head context-dependent weighting without requiring additional fusion parameters. The inter-layer behavior is controlled through a single hyperparameter, the sliding window size, which allows smooth adjustment between purely linear and full attention while keeping all layers structurally uniform. Experimental results show that NHA surpasses Transformers and other hybrid baselines on recall-intensive and commonsense reasoning tasks. Furthermore, pretrained LLMs can be structurally hybridized with NHA, achieving competitive accuracy while delivering significant efficiency gains.

Recent works have addressed this task by adapting state-of-the-art dynamic link property prediction models to node affinity prediction. However, simple heuristics, such as Persistent Forecast or Moving Average, outperform these models. In this work, we analyze the challenges in training current Temporal Graph Neural Networks for node affinity prediction and suggest appropriate solutions. Combining the solutions, we develop NAViS - Node Affinity prediction model using Virtual State, by exploiting the equivalence between heuristics and state space models. While promising, training NAViS is non-trivial. Therefore, we further introduce a novel loss function for node affinity prediction.

To address this problem, we introduce PyCFRL, a Python library for ensuring counterfactual fairness in offline RL. PyCFRL implements a novel data preprocessing algorithm for learning counterfactually fair RL policies from offline datasets and provides tools to evaluate the values and counterfactual unfairness levels of RL policies. We describe the high-level functionalities of PyCFRL and demonstrate one of its major use cases through a data example.

However, existing deep constrained clustering (DCC) methods are either limited by anchors inherent in end-to-end modeling or struggle with learning discriminative Euclidean embedding, restricting their scalability and real-world applicability. To avoid their respective pitfalls, we propose a novel angular constraint embedding approach for DCC, termed SpherePair. Using the SpherePair loss with a geometric formulation, our method faithfully encodes pairwise constraints and leads to embeddings that are clustering-friendly in angular space, effectively separating representation learning from clustering. SpherePair preserves pairwise relations without conflict, removes the need to specify the exact number of clusters, generalizes to unseen data, enables rapid inference of the number of clusters, and is supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees. Comparative evaluations with state-of-the-art DCC methods on diverse benchmarks, along with empirical validation of theoretical insights, confirm its superior performance, scalability, and overall real-world effectiveness.

However, there is currently no standard benchmark to evaluate how well these models perform in medical settings. To address this gap, we introduce M3Retrieve, a Multimodal Medical Retrieval Benchmark. M3Retrieve, spans 5 domains,16 medical fields, and 4 distinct tasks, with over 1.2 Million text documents and 164K multimodal queries, all collected under approved licenses. We evaluate leading multimodal retrieval models on this benchmark to explore the challenges specific to different medical specialities and to understand their impact on retrieval performance. By releasing M3Retrieve, we aim to enable systematic evaluation, foster model innovation, and accelerate research toward building more capable and reliable multimodal retrieval systems for medical applications.

Accurate AI-based severity prediction from medical imaging is essential to support timely clinical decisions and optimize patient outcomes. In this work, we present a novel method applicable to both CT scans and chest X-rays for assessing lung infection severity. Our contributions are twofold: (i) QCross-Att-PVT, a Transformer-based architecture that integrates parallel encoders, a cross-gated attention mechanism, and a feature aggregator to capture rich multi-scale features; and (ii) Conditional Online TransMix, a custom data augmentation strategy designed to address dataset imbalance by generating mixed-label image patches during training.

Previous state-of-the-art methods often face a trade-off between accuracy and speed. Point-based and sparse convolution-based methods are accurate but slow due to the complexity of neighbor searching and 3D convolutions. Projection-based methods are faster but lose critical geometric information during the 2D projection. Additionally, many recent methods rely on test-time augmentation (TTA) to improve performance, which further slows the inference. Moreover, the pre-processing phase across all methods increases execution time and is demanding on embedded platforms. Therefore, we introduce HARP-NeXt, a high-speed and accurate LiDAR semantic segmentation network. We first propose a novel pre-processing methodology that significantly reduces computational overhead. Then, we design the Conv-SE-NeXt feature extraction block to efficiently capture representations without deep layer stacking per network stage. We also employ a multi-scale range-point fusion backbone that leverages information at multiple abstraction levels to preserve essential geometric details, thereby enhancing accuracy. Experiments on the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks show that HARP-NeXt achieves a superior speed-accuracy trade-off compared to all state-of-the-art methods, and, without relying on ensemble models or TTA, is comparable to the top-ranked PTv3, while running 24$\times$ faster.

Existing defenses mainly act at the output level and do not constrain the reasoning process, leaving models exposed to implicit risks. In this paper, we propose SaFeR-VLM, a safety-aligned reinforcement learning framework that embeds safety directly into multimodal reasoning. The framework integrates four components: (I) QI-Safe-10K, a curated dataset emphasizing safety-critical and reasoning-sensitive cases; (II) safety-aware rollout, where unsafe generations undergo reflection and correction instead of being discarded; (III) structured reward modeling with multi-dimensional weighted criteria and explicit penalties for hallucinations and contradictions; and (IV) GRPO optimization, which reinforces both safe and corrected trajectories. This unified design shifts safety from a passive safeguard to an active driver of reasoning, enabling scalable and generalizable safety-aware reasoning. SaFeR-VLM further demonstrates robustness against both explicit and implicit risks, supporting dynamic and interpretable safety decisions beyond surface-level filtering. SaFeR-VLM-3B achieves average performance $70.13$ and $78.97$ on safety and helpfulness across six benchmarks, surpassing both same-scale and $>10\times$ larger models such as Skywork-R1V3-38B, Qwen2.5VL-72B, and GLM4.5V-106B. Remarkably, SaFeR-VLM-7B benefits from its increased scale to surpass GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash by \num{6.47} and \num{16.76} points respectively on safety metrics, achieving this improvement without any degradation in helpfulness performance.

Recent work has explored Multi-LLM Agent Debate (MAD) as a way to enhance performance by enabling multiple LLMs to discuss and refine responses iteratively. Nevertheless, existing MAD methods predominantly focus on utilizing external structures, such as debate graphs, using LLM-as-a-Judge, while neglecting the application of self signals, such as token logits and attention, that arise during generation. This omission leads to redundant computation and potential performance degradation. In this paper, we shift the focus to the self signals of multi-LLM debate and introduce a Self-Signals Driven Multi-LLM Debate (SID), which leverages two types of self-signals: model-level confidence and token-level semantic focus, to adaptively guide the debate process. Our approach enables high-confidence agents to exit early at the model level and compress the redundant debate contents based on the attention mechanism. We evaluate our method on various LLMs and Multimodal LLMs across multiple challenging benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only outperforms existing MAD techniques in accuracy but also reduces token consumption, highlighting the effectiveness of utilizing self signals in enhancing both the performance and efficiency of multi-agent debate systems.

A major challenge lies in the non-stationary nature of quality distributions in real-world scenarios, which limits the generalization ability of conventional methods. We introduce Continual AQA (CAQA), which equips AQA with Continual Learning (CL) capabilities to handle evolving distributions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Although parameter-efficient fine-tuning of pretrained models has shown promise in CL for image classification, we find it insufficient for CAQA. Our empirical and theoretical analyses reveal two insights: (i) Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning (FPFT) is necessary for effective representation learning; yet (ii) uncontrolled FPFT induces overfitting and feature manifold shift, thereby aggravating forgetting. To address this, we propose Adaptive Manifold-Aligned Graph Regularization (MAGR++), which couples backbone fine-tuning that stabilizes shallow layers while adapting deeper ones with a two-step feature rectification pipeline: a manifold projector to translate deviated historical features into the current representation space, and a graph regularizer to align local and global distributions. We construct four CAQA benchmarks from three datasets with tailored evaluation protocols and strong baselines, enabling systematic cross-dataset comparison. Extensive experiments show that MAGR++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, with average correlation gains of 3.6% offline and 12.2% online over the strongest baseline, confirming its robustness and effectiveness.

This paper proposes a hybrid architecture integrating convolutional feature extraction with a temporal fusion transformer (TFT) backbone to enhance multivariate time series forecasting. The CNN module first applies a hierarchy of one-dimensional convolutional layers to distill salient local patterns from raw input sequences, reducing noise and dimensionality. The resulting feature maps are then fed into the TFT, which applies multi-head attention to capture both short- and long-term dependencies and to weigh relevant covariates adaptively. We evaluate the CNN-TFT on a hydroelectric natural flow time series dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that CNN-TFT outperforms well-established deep learning models, with a mean absolute percentage error of up to 2.2%. The explainability of the model is obtained by a proposed Shapley additive explanations with multi-head attention weights (SHAP-MHAW).

Recently, studies on visual prompting, where images are used as prompts, have enabled more precise control over style and content. However, existing methods often suffer from content leakage, where undesired elements of the visual style prompt are transferred along with the intended style. To address this issue, we 1) extend classifier-free guidance (CFG) to utilize swapping self-attention and propose 2) negative visual query guidance (NVQG) to reduce the transfer of unwanted contents. NVQG employs negative score by intentionally simulating content leakage scenarios that swap queries instead of key and values of self-attention layers from visual style prompts. This simple yet effective method significantly reduces content leakage. Furthermore, we provide careful solutions for using a real image as visual style prompts.

Consequently, there is an urgent need for both model owners and third parties to determine whether a suspect LLM is trained from scratch or derived from an existing base model. However, the intensive post-training processes that models typically undergo-such as supervised fine-tuning, extensive continued pretraining, reinforcement learning, multi-modal extension, pruning, and upcycling-pose significant challenges to reliable identification. In this work, we propose a training-free fingerprinting method based on weight matrices. We leverage the Linear Assignment Problem (LAP) and an unbiased Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) similarity to neutralize the effects of parameter manipulations, yielding a highly robust and high-fidelity similarity metric. On a comprehensive testbed of 60 positive and 90 negative model pairs, our method demonstrates exceptional robustness against all six aforementioned post-training categories while exhibiting a near-zero risk of false positives. By achieving perfect scores on all classification metrics, our approach establishes a strong basis for reliable model lineage verification. Moreover, the entire computation completes within 30s on an NVIDIA 3090 GPU. The code is available at https://github.com/LUMIA-Group/AWM.<br>

Rank Manipulation via Two-Stage Token Optimization</a></div></span></div><div id='abs'>Abstract:<br><span id='abs'>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as rerankers in information retrieval, yet their ranking behavior can be steered by small, natural-sounding prompts. To expose this vulnerability, we present Rank Anything First (RAF), a two-stage token optimization method that crafts concise textual perturbations to consistently promote a target item in LLM-generated rankings while remaining hard to detect. Stage 1 uses Greedy Coordinate Gradient to shortlist candidate tokens at the current position by combining the gradient of the rank-target with a readability score; Stage 2 evaluates those candidates under exact ranking and readability losses using an entropy-based dynamic weighting scheme, and selects a token via temperature-controlled sampling. RAF generates ranking-promoting prompts token-by-token, guided by dual objectives: maximizing ranking effectiveness and preserving linguistic naturalness. Experiments across multiple LLMs show that RAF significantly boosts the rank of target items using naturalistic language, with greater robustness than existing methods in both promoting target items and maintaining naturalness. These findings underscore a critical security implication: LLM-based reranking is inherently susceptible to adversarial manipulation, raising new challenges for the trustworthiness and robustness of modern retrieval systems.

Yet, most VLA models are still trained with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which struggles to generalize under distribution shifts due to error accumulation. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by directly optimizing task performance through interaction, but existing attempts remain fragmented and lack a unified platform for fair and systematic comparison across model architectures and algorithmic designs. To address this gap, we introduce RLinf-VLA, a unified and efficient framework for scalable RL training of VLA models. The system adopts a highly flexible resource allocation design that addresses the challenge of integrating rendering, training, and inference in RL+VLA training. In particular, for GPU-parallelized simulators, RLinf-VLA implements a novel hybrid fine-grained pipeline allocation mode, achieving a 1.61x-1.88x speedup in training. Through a unified interface, RLinf-VLA seamlessly supports diverse VLA architectures (e.g., OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT), multiple RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, GRPO), and various simulators (e.g., ManiSkill, LIBERO). In simulation, a unified model achieves 98.11\% across 130 LIBERO tasks and 97.66\% across 25 ManiSkill tasks. Beyond empirical performance, our study distills a set of best practices for applying RL to VLA training and sheds light on emerging patterns in this integration. Furthermore, we present preliminary deployment on a real-world Franka robot, where RL-trained policies exhibit stronger generalization than those trained with SFT. We envision RLinf-VLA as a foundation to accelerate and standardize research on embodied intelligence.<br>

Conducting systematic reviews is laborious, especially during the screening or study selection phase, where the number of papers can be overwhelming. During this phase, papers are assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria based on their titles and abstracts. Recent research has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can perform title-abstract screening at a level comparable to that of a master's student. While LLMs cannot be fully trusted, they can help, for example, in Rapid Reviews, which try to expedite the review process. Building on recent research, we developed AiSysRev, an LLM-based screening tool implemented as a web application running in a Docker container. The tool accepts a CSV file containing paper titles and abstracts. Users specify inclusion and exclusion criteria. One can use multiple LLMs for screening via OpenRouter. AiSysRev supports both zero-shot and few-shot screening, and also allows for manual screening through interfaces that display LLM results as guidance for human reviewers.We conducted a trial study with 137 papers using the tool. Our findings indicate that papers can be classified into four categories: Easy Includes, Easy Excludes, Boundary Includes, and Boundary Excludes. The Boundary cases, where LLMs are prone to errors, highlight the need for human intervention. While LLMs do not replace human judgment in systematic reviews, they can significantly reduce the burden of assessing large volumes of scientific literature.

However, irregular sampling and missing values present significant challenges. While prior methods address these irregularities, they often yield suboptimal results and incur high computational costs. Recent advances in regular time series generation, such as the diffusion-based ImagenTime model, demonstrate strong, fast, and scalable generative capabilities by transforming time series into image representations, making them a promising solution. However, extending ImagenTime to irregular sequences using simple masking introduces "unnatural" neighborhoods, where missing values replaced by zeros disrupt the learning process. To overcome this, we propose a novel two-step framework: first, a Time Series Transformer completes irregular sequences, creating natural neighborhoods; second, a vision-based diffusion model with masking minimizes dependence on the completed values. This approach leverages the strengths of both completion and masking, enabling robust and efficient generation of realistic time series. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving a relative improvement in discriminative score by $70\%$ and in computational cost by $85\%$.

Traditional approaches often rely on selected observables, which may miss subtle but physically relevant structures in the data. To address this, we introduce a Transformer-based autoencoder trained with a two-stage paradigm: self-supervised pre-training followed by supervised fine-tuning. The pretrained encoder learns latent representations directly from unlabeled HIC data, providing a compact and information-rich feature space that can be adapted to diverse physics tasks. As a case study, we apply the method to distinguish between large and small collision systems, where it achieves significantly higher classification accuracy than PointNet. Principal component analysis and SHAP interpretation further demonstrate that the autoencoder captures complex nonlinear correlations beyond individual observables, yielding features with strong discriminative and explanatory power. These results establish our two-stage framework as a general and robust foundation for feature learning in HIC, opening the door to more powerful analyses of quark--gluon plasma properties and other emergent phenomena.

However, its effectiveness depends on high-quality instruction data. Most existing alignment datasets are either private or require costly human annotation, which limits reproducibility and scalability. Even with Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF), concerns about data quality remain. Moreover, it is unclear how much data is actually required to fine-tune a base model into a strong instruction-following model. Current approaches often rely on over 300k examples even at the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, yet they still underperform compared to proprietary models, creating barriers for academic and resource-limited communities. To address this gap, we introduce PiKa, a data-efficient family of expert-level alignment datasets. In particular, the PiKa-SFT dataset uses only 30k SFT examples, far fewer than state-of-the-art datasets like Magpie. Through evaluations by fine-tuning Llama-3-8B-Base on PiKa and other public datasets, we show that PiKa-SFT outperforms models trained on much larger data. On AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard benchmarks, PiKa-SFT fine-tuning even surpasses the official Llama-3-8B-Instruct model trained on over 10 million proprietary examples. We further extend our study by training the Qwen2.5 series (0.5B to 7B) on PiKa-SFT, achieving consistent gains. These findings demonstrate that high-quality alignment can be achieved with significantly less data, offering a scalable path for open-source LLM alignment.

Due to the diverse shapes and sizes of surface defects, SDD faces two main challenges: intraclass difference and interclass similarity. Existing methods primarily utilize manually designed models, which require extensive trial and error and often struggle to address both challenges effectively. To overcome this, we propose AutoNAD, an automated neural architecture design framework for SDD that jointly searches over convolutions, transformers, and multi-layer perceptrons. This hybrid design enables the model to capture both fine-grained local variations and long-range semantic context, addressing the two key challenges while reducing the cost of manual network design. To support efficient training of such a diverse search space, AutoNAD introduces a cross weight sharing strategy, which accelerates supernet convergence and improves subnet performance. Additionally, a searchable multi-level feature aggregation module (MFAM) is integrated to enhance multi-scale feature learning. Beyond detection accuracy, runtime efficiency is essential for industrial deployment. To this end, AutoNAD incorporates a latency-aware prior to guide the selection of efficient architectures. The effectiveness of AutoNAD is validated on three industrial defect datasets and further applied within a defect imaging and detection platform.

Addressing this, we identify notable redundancies across the SLAM pipeline for acceleration. While conceptually straightforward, practical approaches are required to minimize the overhead associated with identifying and eliminating these redundancies. In response, we propose RTGS, an algorithm-hardware co-design framework that comprehensively reduces the redundancies for real-time 3DGS-SLAM on edge. To minimize the overhead, RTGS fully leverages the characteristics of the 3DGS-SLAM pipeline. On the algorithm side, we introduce (1) an adaptive Gaussian pruning step to remove the redundant Gaussians by reusing gradients computed during backpropagation; and (2) a dynamic downsampling technique that directly reuses the keyframe identification and alpha computing steps to eliminate redundant pixels. On the hardware side, we propose (1) a subtile-level streaming strategy and a pixel-level pairwise scheduling strategy that mitigates workload imbalance via a Workload Scheduling Unit (WSU) guided by previous iteration information; (2) a Rendering and Backpropagation (R&B) Buffer that accelerates the rendering backpropagation by reusing intermediate data computed during rendering; and (3) a Gradient Merging Unit (GMU) to reduce intensive memory accesses caused by atomic operations while enabling pipelined aggregation. Integrated into an edge GPU, RTGS achieves real-time performance (>= 30 FPS) on four datasets and three algorithms, with up to 82.5x energy efficiency over the baseline and negligible quality loss.

The core idea is to apply a muon-style projection to $ΔW$, the difference between the fine-tuned and pretrained weights. This projection uses truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) to equalize the influence of dominant update directions and prune small singular values, which often represent noise. As a simple post-processing step, POME is completely decoupled from the training pipeline. It requires zero modifications and imposes no overhead, making it universally compatible with any optimizer or distributed framework. POME delivers consistent gains, boosting average performance by +2.5\% on GSM8K and +1.0\% on code generation. Its broad applicability -- from 7B foundation models to 72B RLHF-instructed models -- establishes it as a practical, zero-cost enhancement for any fine-tuning pipeline.

Multispectral imagery, which captures pixel-level spectral reflectance, enhances target discriminability. However, the availability of multispectral tracking datasets remains limited. To bridge this gap, we introduce MSITrack, the largest and most diverse multispectral single object tracking dataset to date. MSITrack offers the following key features: (i) More Challenging Attributes-including interference from similar objects and similarity in color and texture between targets and backgrounds in natural scenarios, along with a wide range of real-world tracking challenges; (ii) Richer and More Natural Scenes-spanning 55 object categories and 300 distinct natural scenes, MSITrack far exceeds the scope of existing benchmarks. Many of these scenes and categories are introduced to the multispectral tracking domain for the first time; (iii) Larger Scale-300 videos comprising over 129k frames of multispectral imagery. To ensure annotation precision, each frame has undergone meticulous processing, manual labeling and multi-stage verification. Extensive evaluations using representative trackers demonstrate that the multispectral data in MSITrack significantly improves performance over RGB-only baselines, highlighting its potential to drive future advancements in the field.

The scarcity of large-scale, well-annotated datasets poses significant challenges in creating robust models. To address this, synthetic data generated through simulations and generative models has emerged as a promising solution, enhancing dataset diversity and improving the performance, reliability, and resilience of models. However, evaluating the quality of this generated data requires an effective metric. This paper introduces the Synthetic Dataset Quality Metric (SDQM) to assess data quality for object detection tasks without requiring model training to converge. This metric enables more efficient generation and selection of synthetic datasets, addressing a key challenge in resource-constrained object detection tasks. In our experiments, SDQM demonstrated a strong correlation with the mean Average Precision (mAP) scores of YOLOv11, a leading object detection model, while previous metrics only exhibited moderate or weak correlations. Additionally, it provides actionable insights for improving dataset quality, minimizing the need for costly iterative training. This scalable and efficient metric sets a new standard for evaluating synthetic data. The code for SDQM is available at https://github.com/ayushzenith/SDQM<br>

However, differences in staining protocols and imaging conditions can introduce significant color variability. In deep learning, such color inconsistency often reduces performance when deploying models on data acquired under different conditions from the training data, a challenge known as domain shift. Many existing methods attempt to address this problem via color normalization but suffer from several notable drawbacks such as introducing artifacts or requiring careful choice of a template image for stain mapping. To address these limitations, we propose a trainable color normalization model that can be integrated with any backbone network for downstream tasks such as object detection and classification. Based on the physics of the imaging process per the Beer-Lambert law, our model architecture is derived via algorithmic unrolling of a nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) model to extract stain-invariant structural information from the original pathology images, which serves as input for further processing. Experimentally, we evaluate the method on publicly available pathology datasets and an internally curated collection of malaria blood smears for cross-domain object detection and classification, where our method outperforms many state-of-the-art stain normalization methods.

Existing methods typically employ tokenizers in discrete latent spaces to align with the tokens from large language models, where the quantization errors can limit semantic expressiveness and degrade the capability of vision-language understanding. To address this, we introduce MingTok, a new family of visual tokenizers with a continuous latent space, for unified autoregressive generation and understanding. While understanding tasks favor discriminative high-dimensional features, generation tasks prefer compact low-level codes. Thus, to reconcile these competing demands, MingTok adopts a three-stage sequential architecture involving low-level encoding, semantic expansion, and visual reconstruction. Built on top of it, Ming-UniVision eliminates the need for task-specific visual representations, and unifies diverse vision-language tasks under a single autoregrsssive prediction paradigm. By formulating both understanding and generation as next-token prediction in a shared continuous space, it seamlessly supports multi-round, in-context tasks such as iterative understanding, generation and editing. Empirically, we find that using a unified continuous visual representation reconciles the competing requirements on the tokenizers by the understanding and generation tasks, thereby leading to state-of-the-art level performance across both domains. We hope our findings will facilitate unified visual tokenization in the continuous domain. Inference code and model weights are released to benefit community.<br>

We consider a parabolic PDE with a time-varying domain governed by a second-order response with respect to the Neumann boundary value of the PDE state at the moving boundary. The objective is to design a boundary heat flux control to stabilize the moving boundary at a desired setpoint, with satisfying the required conditions of the model on PDE state and the moving boundary. We apply a PDE backstepping method for the control design with considering a constraint on the control law. The PDE and moving boundary constraints are shown to be satisfied by applying the maximum principle for parabolic PDEs. Then the closed-loop system is shown to be globally exponentially stable by performing Lyapunov analysis. The proposed control is implemented in numerical simulation, which illustrates the desired performance in safety and stability. An outline of the extension to third-order moving boundary dynamics is also presented. Code is released at https://github.com/shumon0423/HighOrderStefan_CDC2025.git.<br>

Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for both visual and textual generation. Existing approaches can be broadly categorized into classifier-free guidance (CFG) and classifier guidance (CG) methods. While CFG effectively preserves semantic content, it often fails to provide effective attribute control. In contrast, CG modifies the denoising trajectory using classifier gradients, enabling better attribute alignment but incurring high computational costs during sampling and suffering from classifier generalization issues. In this work, we propose RegDiff, a regularized diffusion framework that leverages attribute features without requiring a pretrained classifier during sampling, thereby achieving controllable generation with reduced computational costs. Specifically, RegDiff employs a VAE-based encoder--decoder architecture to ensure reconstruction fidelity and a latent diffusion model trained with attribute supervision to enable controllable text generation. Attribute information is injected only during training. Experiments on five datasets spanning multiple stylistic attributes demonstrate that RegDiff outperforms strong baselines in generating stylistic texts. These results validate the effectiveness of RegDiff as an efficient solution for attribute-controllable text diffusion. Our code, datasets, and resources will be released upon publication at https://github.com/xxxx.<br>

However, existing consensus-seeking approaches typically rely on voting mechanisms to judge consensus, overlooking contradictions in system-internal beliefs that destabilize the consensus. Moreover, these methods often involve agents updating their results through indiscriminate collaboration with every other agent. Such uniform interaction fails to identify the optimal collaborators for each agent, hindering the emergence of a stable consensus. To address these challenges, we provide a theoretical framework for selecting optimal collaborators that maximize consensus stability. Based on the theorems, we propose the Belief-Calibrated Consensus Seeking (BCCS) framework to facilitate stable consensus via selecting optimal collaborators and calibrating the consensus judgment by system-internal beliefs. Experimental results on the MATH and MMLU benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed BCCS framework outperforms the best existing results by 2.23% and 3.95% of accuracy on challenging tasks, respectively.

To solve novel problems, agents should acquire skills for exploring and learning through experience. Finding a scalable learning mechanism for developing agents that learn through interaction remains a major open problem. In this work, we introduce BuilderBench, a benchmark to accelerate research into agent pre-training that centers open-ended exploration. BuilderBench requires agents to learn how to build any structure using blocks. BuilderBench is equipped with $(1)$ a hardware accelerated simulator of a robotic agent interacting with various physical blocks, and $(2)$ a task-suite with over 42 diverse target structures that are carefully curated to test an understanding of physics, mathematics, and long-horizon planning. During training, agents have to explore and learn general principles about the environment without any external supervision. During evaluation, agents have to build the unseen target structures from the task suite. Solving these tasks requires a sort of \emph{embodied reasoning} that is not reflected in words but rather in actions, experimenting with different strategies and piecing them together. Our experiments show that many of these tasks challenge the current iteration of algorithms. Hence, we also provide a ``training wheels'' protocol, in which agents are trained and evaluated to build a single target structure from the task suite. Finally, we provide single-file implementations of six different algorithms as a reference point for researchers.<br>

However, conventional training methods based on surrogate gradients and Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) not only lag behind Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in performance, but also incur significant computational and memory overheads that grow linearly with the temporal dimension. To enable high-performance SNN training under limited computational resources, we propose an enhanced self-distillation framework, jointly optimized with rate-based backpropagation. Specifically, the firing rates of intermediate SNN layers are projected onto lightweight ANN branches, and high-quality knowledge generated by the model itself is used to optimize substructures through the ANN pathways. Unlike traditional self-distillation paradigms, we observe that low-quality self-generated knowledge may hinder convergence. To address this, we decouple the teacher signal into reliable and unreliable components, ensuring that only reliable knowledge is used to guide the optimization of the model. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CIFAR10-DVS, and ImageNet demonstrate that our method reduces training complexity while achieving high-performance SNN training.

Although multi-agent large language models enhance reasoning depth, they suffer from uncontrolled iterations and unverifiable outputs, and conventional distillation methods struggle to transfer collaborative reasoning capabilities to lightweight, deployable student models. To address these challenges, we propose Knowledge Graph-guided Multi-Agent System Distillation (KG-MASD). Our approach formulates distillation as a Markov Decision Process and incorporates a knowledge graph as a verifiable structured prior to enrich state representation and ensure convergence.

Most production applications were never designed with speech in mind. This article provides a concrete architecture that enables GUIs to interface with LLM-based speech-enabled assistants. The architecture makes an application's navigation graph and semantics available through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The ViewModel, part of the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern, exposes the application's capabilities to the assistant by supplying both tools applicable to a currently visible view and application-global tools extracted from the GUI tree router. This architecture facilitates full voice accessibility while ensuring reliable alignment between spoken input and the visual interface, accompanied by consistent feedback across modalities. It future-proofs apps for upcoming OS super assistants that employ computer use agents (CUAs) and natively consume MCP if an application provides it. To address concerns about privacy and data security, the practical effectiveness of locally deployable, open-weight LLMs for speech-enabled multimodal UIs is evaluated. Findings suggest that recent smaller open-weight models approach the performance of leading proprietary models in overall accuracy and require enterprise-grade hardware for fast responsiveness.

Unlike previous approaches that rely on multi-stage pipelines, iterative contact-aware refinement between humans and scenes, and heavy dependencies, e.g., human detection, depth estimation, and SLAM pre-processing, Human3R jointly recovers global multi-person SMPL-X bodies ("everyone"), dense 3D scene ("everywhere"), and camera trajectories in a single forward pass ("all-at-once"). Our method builds upon the 4D online reconstruction model CUT3R, and uses parameter-efficient visual prompt tuning, to strive to preserve CUT3R's rich spatiotemporal priors, while enabling direct readout of multiple SMPL-X bodies. Human3R is a unified model that eliminates heavy dependencies and iterative refinement. After being trained on the relatively small-scale synthetic dataset BEDLAM for just one day on one GPU, it achieves superior performance with remarkable efficiency: it reconstructs multiple humans in a one-shot manner, along with 3D scenes, in one stage, at real-time speed (15 FPS) with a low memory footprint (8 GB). Extensive experiments demonstrate that Human3R delivers state-of-the-art or competitive performance across tasks, including global human motion estimation, local human mesh recovery, video depth estimation, and camera pose estimation, with a single unified model. We hope that Human3R will serve as a simple yet strong baseline, be easily extended for downstream applications.Code available in https://fanegg.github.io/Human3R<br>

Running LLMs locally on mobile and edge devices (on-device LLMs) offers the promise of enhanced privacy, reliability, and reduced communication costs. However, realizing this vision remains challenging due to substantial memory and compute demands, as well as limited visibility into performance-efficiency trade-offs on resource-constrained hardware. We propose lm-Meter, the first lightweight, online latency profiler tailored for on-device LLM inference. lm-Meter captures fine-grained, real-time latency at both phase (e.g., embedding, prefill, decode, softmax, sampling) and kernel levels without auxiliary devices. We implement lm-Meter on commercial mobile platforms and demonstrate its high profiling accuracy with minimal system overhead, e.g., only 2.58% throughput reduction in prefill and 0.99% in decode under the most constrained Powersave governor. Leveraging lm-Meter, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies revealing phase- and kernel-level bottlenecks in on-device LLM inference, quantifying accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, and identifying systematic optimization opportunities. lm-Meter provides unprecedented visibility into the runtime behavior of LLMs on constrained platforms, laying the foundation for informed optimization and accelerating the democratization of on-device LLM systems.

While these metrics can rank generative models, they do not provide an absolute measure of performance. Their values are also highly sensitive to extrinsic parameters, namely kernel and descriptor parametrization, making them incomparable across different graph descriptors. We introduce PolyGraph Discrepancy (PGD), a new evaluation framework that addresses these limitations. It approximates the Jensen-Shannon distance of graph distributions by fitting binary classifiers to distinguish between real and generated graphs, featurized by these descriptors. The data log-likelihood of these classifiers approximates a variational lower bound on the JS distance between the two distributions. Resulting metrics are constrained to the unit interval [0,1] and are comparable across different graph descriptors. We further derive a theoretically grounded summary metric that combines these individual metrics to provide a maximally tight lower bound on the distance for the given descriptors. Thorough experiments demonstrate that PGD provides a more robust and insightful evaluation compared to MMD metrics.

However, the models currently in use are often difficult to interpret, which reduces their usefulness in clinical settings. Prototype learning presents a potential solution, yet traditional methods focus on local similarities and static matching, neglecting the broader tumor context and lacking strong semantic alignment with genomic data. To overcome these issues, we introduce an innovative prototype-based multimodal framework, FeatProto, aimed at enhancing cancer survival prediction by addressing significant limitations in current prototype learning methodologies within pathology. Our framework establishes a unified feature prototype space that integrates both global and local features of whole slide images (WSI) with genomic profiles. This integration facilitates traceable and interpretable decision-making processes. Our approach includes three main innovations: (1) A robust phenotype representation that merges critical patches with global context, harmonized with genomic data to minimize local bias. (2) An Exponential Prototype Update Strategy (EMA ProtoUp) that sustains stable cross-modal associations and employs a wandering mechanism to adapt prototypes flexibly to tumor heterogeneity. (3) A hierarchical prototype matching scheme designed to capture global centrality, local typicality, and cohort-level trends, thereby refining prototype inference. Comprehensive evaluations on four publicly available cancer datasets indicate that our method surpasses current leading unimodal and multimodal survival prediction techniques in both accuracy and interoperability, providing a new perspective on prototype learning for critical medical applications.

To date, a variety of fusion methods have been proposed, among which the tensor-based ones have testified that multiple priors, such as multidimensional low-rankness and spatial total variation at multiple levels, effectively drive the fusion process. However, existing tensor-based models can only effectively leverage one or two priors at one or two levels, since simultaneously incorporating multi-level priors inevitably increases model complexity. This introduces challenges in both balancing the weights of different priors and optimizing multi-block structures. Concerning this, we present a novel hyperspectral super-resolution model compactly characterizing these multi-level priors of hyperspectral images within the tensor framework. Firstly, the proposed model decouples the spectral low-rankness and spatial priors by casting the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution image into spectral subspace and spatial maps via block term decomposition. Secondly, these spatial maps are stacked as the spatial tensor encoding the high-order spatial low-rankness and smoothness priors, which are co-modeled via the proposed non-convex mode-shuffled tensor correlated total variation. Finally, we draw inspiration from the linearized alternating direction method of multipliers to design an efficient algorithm to optimize the resulting model, theoretically proving its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker convergence under mild conditions. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The code implementation will be available from https://github.com/WongYinJ.<br>

Prior work on Decision-Maker Alignment (DMA) has explored two primary strategies: (1) classical AI methods integrating case-based reasoning, Bayesian reasoning, and naturalistic decision-making, and (2) large language model (LLM)-based methods leveraging prompt engineering. While both approaches have shown promise in limited domains such as medical triage, their generalizability to novel contexts remains underexplored. In this work, we implement a prior classical AI model and develop an LLM-based algorithmic decision-maker evaluated using a large reasoning model (GPT-5) and a non-reasoning model (GPT-4) with weighted self-consistency under a zero-shot prompting framework, as proposed in recent literature. We evaluate both approaches on a health insurance decision-making dataset annotated for three target decision-makers with varying levels of risk tolerance (0.0, 0.5, 1.0). In the experiments reported herein, classical AI and LLM-based models achieved comparable alignment with attribute-based targets, with classical AI exhibiting slightly better alignment for a moderate risk profile.

To address this gap for one of the most common chart types, we introduce a synthetic, annotated dataset of over 18,000 scatterplots from six data generators and 17 chart designs, and a benchmark based on it. We evaluate proprietary models from OpenAI and Google using N-shot prompting on five distinct tasks derived from annotations of cluster bounding boxes, their center coordinates, and outlier coordinates. OpenAI models and Gemini 2.5 Flash, especially when prompted with examples, are viable options for counting clusters and, in Flash's case, outliers (90%+ Accuracy). However, the results for localization-related tasks are unsatisfactory: Precision and Recall are near or below 50%, except for Flash in outlier identification (65.01%). Furthermore, the impact of chart design on performance appears to be a secondary factor, but it is advisable to avoid scatterplots with wide aspect ratios (16:9 and 21:9) or those colored randomly.

However, we identify a fundamental flaw in this Outcome-Supervised RL (OSRL) paradigm: the Importance Sampling (IS) ratios of positive-advantage tokens are mismatched, leading to unbalanced token weighting for positive and negative tokens. This mismatch suppresses the update of low-probability tokens while over-amplifying already high-probability ones. To address this, we propose Asymmetric Importance Sampling Policy Optimization (ASPO), which uses a simple yet effective strategy that flips the IS ratios of positive-advantage tokens, aligning their update direction with the learning dynamics of negative ones. AIS further incorporates a soft dual-clipping mechanism to stabilize extreme updates while maintaining gradient flow. Comprehensive experiments on coding and mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ASPO significantly mitigates premature convergence, improves training stability, and enhances final performance over strong GRPO-based baselines. Our analysis provides new insights into the role of token-level weighting in OSRL and highlights the critical importance of correcting IS in LLM RL.

We present DeepEvolve, an agent that integrates deep research with algorithm evolution, uniting external knowledge retrieval, cross-file code editing, and systematic debugging under a feedback-driven iterative loop. Each iteration not only proposes new hypotheses but also refines, implements, and tests them, avoiding both shallow improvements and unproductive over-refinements. Across nine benchmarks in chemistry, mathematics, biology, materials, and patents, DeepEvolve consistently improves the initial algorithm, producing executable new algorithms with sustained gains.

However, for end-to-end video understanding with LLMs, uniformly sampling video frames results in LLMs being overwhelmed by a vast amount of irrelevant information as video length increases. Existing hierarchical key frame extraction methods improve the accuracy of video understanding but still face two critical challenges. 1) How can the interference of extensive redundant information in long videos be mitigated? 2) How can a model dynamically adapt to complex hierarchical structures while accurately identifying key frames? To address these issues, we propose VideoMiner, which iteratively segments, captions, and clusters long videos, forming a hierarchical tree structure. The proposed VideoMiner progresses from long videos to events to frames while preserving temporal coherence, effectively addressing the first challenge. To precisely locate key frames, we introduce T-GRPO, a tree-based group relative policy optimization in reinforcement learning method that guides the exploration of the VideoMiner. The proposed T-GRPO is specifically designed for tree structures, integrating spatiotemporal information at the event level while being guided by the question, thus solving the second challenge. We achieve superior performance in all long-video understanding tasks and uncover several interesting insights. Our proposed T-GRPO surprisingly incentivizes the model to spontaneously generate a reasoning chain. Additionally, the designed tree growth auxin dynamically adjusts the expansion depth, obtaining accuracy and efficiency gains.

However, the coordinate origin of SLAM estimate often resets for each run. On the other hand, UWB-based localization with fixed anchors can ensure a consistent coordinate reference across sessions; however, it requires an accurate assignment of the anchor nodes' coordinates. To this end, we propose a two-stage approach that calibrates and fuses UWB data and SLAM data to achieve coordinate-wise consistent and accurate localization in the same environment. In the first stage, we solve a continuous-time batch optimization problem by using the range and odometry data from one full run, incorporating height priors and anchor-to-anchor distance factors to recover the anchors' 3D positions. For the subsequent runs in the second stage, a sliding-window optimization scheme fuses the UWB and SLAM data, which facilitates accurate localization in the same coordinate system. Experiments are carried out on the NTU VIRAL dataset with six scenarios of UAV flight, and we show that calibration using data in one run is sufficient to enable accurate localization in the remaining runs.

An Analysis of MetaFormer's Token Mixing for Medical Imaging</a></div></span></div><div id='abs'>Abstract:<br><span id='abs'>The generalization of the Transformer architecture via MetaFormer has reshaped our understanding of its success in computer vision. By replacing self-attention with simpler token mixers, MetaFormer provides strong baselines for vision tasks. However, while extensively studied on natural image datasets, its use in medical imaging remains scarce, and existing works rarely compare different token mixers, potentially overlooking more suitable designs choices. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of token mixers for medical imaging. We systematically analyze pooling-, convolution-, and attention-based token mixers within the MetaFormer architecture on image classification (global prediction task) and semantic segmentation (dense prediction task). Our evaluation spans eight datasets covering diverse modalities and common challenges in the medical domain. Given the prevalence of pretraining from natural images to mitigate medical data scarcity, we also examine transferring pretrained weights to new token mixers. Our results show that, for classification, low-complexity token mixers (e.g. grouped convolution or pooling) are sufficient, aligning with findings on natural images. Pretrained weights remain useful despite the domain gap introduced by the new token mixer. For segmentation, we find that the local inductive bias of convolutional token mixers is essential. Grouped convolutions emerge as the preferred choice, as they reduce runtime and parameter count compared to standard convolutions, while the MetaFormer's channel-MLPs already provide the necessary cross-channel interactions.

Recent reasoning-oriented large language models (LLMs) show promise in understanding temporal patterns, but purely zero-shot usage remains suboptimal. We propose FETA, a multi-agent framework for training-free TSC via exemplar-based in-context reasoning. FETA decomposes a multivariate series into channel-wise subproblems, retrieves a few structurally similar labeled examples for each channel, and leverages a reasoning LLM to compare the query against these exemplars, producing channel-level labels with self-assessed confidences; a confidence-weighted aggregator then fuses all channel decisions. This design eliminates the need for pretraining or fine-tuning, improves efficiency by pruning irrelevant channels and controlling input length, and enhances interpretability through exemplar grounding and confidence estimation. On nine challenging UEA datasets, FETA achieves strong accuracy under a fully training-free setting, surpassing multiple trained baselines. These results demonstrate that a multi-agent in-context reasoning framework can transform LLMs into competitive, plug-and-play TSC solvers without any parameter training.

While persuasion-based optimization has shown promise in debate settings, it has not been systematically compared against mainstream truth-based approaches. We introduce DebateQD, a minimal Quality-Diversity (QD) evolutionary algorithm that evolves diverse debate strategies across different categories (rationality, authority, emotional appeal, etc.) through tournament-style competitions where two LLMs debate while a third judges. Unlike previously proposed methods that require a population of LLMs, our approach maintains diversity of opponents through prompt-based strategies within a single LLM architecture, making it more accessible for experiments while preserving the key benefits of population-based optimization. In contrast to prior work, we explicitly isolate the role of the optimization objective by fixing the debate protocol and swapping only the fitness function: persuasion rewards strategies that convince the judge irrespective of truth, whereas truth rewards collaborative correctness. Across three model scales (7B, 32B, 72B parameters) and multiple dataset sizes from the QuALITY benchmark, persuasion-optimized strategies achieve up to 13.94% smaller train-test generalization gaps, while matching or exceeding truth optimization's test performance. These results provide the first controlled evidence that competitive pressure to persuade, rather than seek the truth collaboratively, fosters more transferable reasoning skills, offering a promising path for improving LLM generalization.<br>

Interactive models need repeated user prompts for each image, while ICL relies on dense, pixel-level labels. To address this, we propose Weakly Supervised In-Context Learning (WS-ICL), a new ICL paradigm that leverages weak prompts (e.g., bounding boxes or points) instead of dense labels for context. This approach significantly reduces annotation effort by eliminating the need for fine-grained masks and repeated user prompting for all images. We evaluated the proposed WS-ICL model on three held-out benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that WS-ICL achieves performance comparable to regular ICL models at a significantly lower annotation cost. In addition, WS-ICL is highly competitive even under the interactive paradigm. These findings establish WS-ICL as a promising step toward more efficient and unified universal models for medical image segmentation.

Unlike previous GAN or diffusion-based methods, AR models generate images through discrete token prediction, exhibiting both marked improvements in image synthesis quality and unique characteristics in their vector-quantized representations. In this paper, we propose to leverage Discrete Distribution Discrepancy-aware Quantization Error (D$^3$QE) for autoregressive-generated image detection that exploits the distinctive patterns and the frequency distribution bias of the codebook existing in real and fake images. We introduce a discrete distribution discrepancy-aware transformer that integrates dynamic codebook frequency statistics into its attention mechanism, fusing semantic features and quantization error latent. To evaluate our method, we construct a comprehensive dataset termed ARForensics covering 7 mainstream visual AR models.

High-throughput setups with tens to hundreds of parallel cell cultivations offer the potential for robust and reproducible insights. However, these insights are obscured by the large amount of LCI data recorded per experiment. Recent advances in state-of-the-art deep learning methods for cell segmentation and tracking now enable the automated analysis of such large data volumes, offering unprecedented opportunities to systematically study single-cell dynamics. The next key challenge lies in integrating these powerful tools into accessible, flexible, and user-friendly workflows that support routine application in biological research. In this work, we present acia-workflows, a platform that combines three key components: (1) the Automated live-Cell Imaging Analysis (acia) Python library, which supports the modular design of image analysis pipelines offering eight deep learning segmentation and tracking approaches; (2) workflows that assemble the image analysis pipeline, its software dependencies, documentation, and visualizations into a single Jupyter Notebook, leading to accessible, reproducible and scalable analysis workflows; and (3) a collection of application workflows showcasing the analysis and customization capabilities in real-world applications. Specifically, we present three workflows to investigate various types of microfluidic LCI experiments ranging from growth rate comparisons to precise, minute-resolution quantitative analyses of individual dynamic cells responses to changing oxygen conditions.

However, it remains challenging due to heterogeneous data sources and complex traffic dynamics. Moreover, conventional approaches typically convert trajectories into fixed-length representations, neglecting the inherent variability of real-world trajectories, which often leads to information loss or feature redundancy. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Multimodal Dynamic Trajectory Integration (MDTI) framework--a novel multimodal trajectory representation learning approach that integrates GPS sequences, grid trajectories, and road network constraints to enhance TTE accuracy. MDTI employs modality-specific encoders and a cross-modal interaction module to capture complementary spatial, temporal, and topological semantics, while a dynamic trajectory modeling mechanism adaptively regulates information density for trajectories of varying lengths. Two self-supervised pretraining objectives, named contrastive alignment and masked language modeling, further strengthen multimodal consistency and contextual understanding. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MDTI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its robustness and strong generalization abilities.

Previous studies mainly focus on complex feature extraction and fusion to learn discriminative information from multimodal content. However, in real-world applications, multimedia news may naturally lose some information during dissemination, resulting in modality incompleteness, which is detrimental to the generalization and robustness of existing models. To this end, we propose a novel generic and robust multimodal fusion strategy, termed Multi-expert Modality-incomplete Learning Network (MMLNet), which is simple yet effective. It consists of three key steps: (1) Multi-Expert Collaborative Reasoning to compensate for missing modalities by dynamically leveraging complementary information through multiple experts. (2) Incomplete Modality Adapters compensates for the missing information by leveraging the new feature distribution. (3) Modality Missing Learning leveraging an label-aware adaptive weighting strategy to learn a robust representation with contrastive learning. We evaluate MMLNet on three real-world benchmarks across two languages, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining relative simplicity. By ensuring the accuracy of fake news detection in incomplete modality scenarios caused by information propagation, MMLNet effectively curbs the spread of malicious misinformation.

Accurate cardiac keyframe detection can eliminate this problem. However, automatic methods solely derive end-systole (ES) and end-diastole (ED) frames from left ventricular volume curves, which do not provide a deeper insight into myocardial motion. We propose a self-supervised deep learning method detecting five keyframes in short-axis (SAX) and four-chamber long-axis (4CH) cine CMR. Initially, dense deformable registration fields are derived from the images and used to compute a 1D motion descriptor, which provides valuable insights into global cardiac contraction and relaxation patterns. From these characteristic curves, keyframes are determined using a simple set of rules. The method was independently evaluated for both views using three public, multicentre, multidisease datasets. M&Ms-2 (n=360) dataset was used for training and evaluation, and M&Ms (n=345) and ACDC (n=100) datasets for repeatability control. Furthermore, generalisability to patients with rare congenital heart defects was tested using the German Competence Network (GCN) dataset. Our self-supervised approach achieved improved detection accuracy by 30% - 51% for SAX and 11% - 47% for 4CH in ED and ES, as measured by cyclic frame difference (cFD), compared with the volume-based approach. We can detect ED and ES, as well as three additional keyframes throughout the cardiac cycle with a mean cFD below 1.31 frames for SAX and 1.73 for LAX. Our approach enables temporally aligned inter- and intra-patient analysis of cardiac dynamics, irrespective of cycle or phase lengths.

A Causal Perspective</a></div></span></div><div id='abs'>Abstract:<br><span id='abs'>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in node classification. Building on this progress, heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) integrate relation types and node and edge semantics to leverage heterogeneous information. Causal analysis for HGNNs is advancing rapidly, aiming to separate genuine causal effects from spurious correlations. However, whether HGNNs are intrinsically effective remains underexamined, and most studies implicitly assume rather than establish this effectiveness. In this work, we examine HGNNs from two perspectives: model architecture and heterogeneous information. We conduct a systematic reproduction across 21 datasets and 20 baselines, complemented by comprehensive hyperparameter retuning. To further disentangle the source of performance gains, we develop a causal effect estimation framework that constructs and evaluates candidate factors under standard assumptions through factual and counterfactual analyses, with robustness validated via minimal sufficient adjustment sets, cross-method consistency checks, and sensitivity analyses. Our results lead to two conclusions. First, model architecture and complexity have no causal effect on performance. Second, heterogeneous information exerts a positive causal effect by increasing homophily and local-global distribution discrepancy, which makes node classes more distinguishable.

Although most of the work has now focused on cross-generator generalization, we argue that this viewpoint is too limited. Detecting synthetic images involves another equally important challenge: generalization across visual domains. To bridge this gap,we present the OmniGen Benchmark. This comprehensive evaluation dataset incorporates 12 state-of-the-art generators, providing a more realistic way of evaluating detector performance under realistic conditions. In addition, we introduce a new method, FusionDetect, aimed at addressing both vectors of generalization. FusionDetect draws on the benefits of two frozen foundation models: CLIP & Dinov2. By deriving features from both complementary models,we develop a cohesive feature space that naturally adapts to changes in both thecontent and design of the generator. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that FusionDetect delivers not only a new state-of-the-art, which is 3.87% more accurate than its closest competitor and 6.13% more precise on average on established benchmarks, but also achieves a 4.48% increase in accuracy on OmniGen,along with exceptional robustness to common image perturbations.

Deterministic collision checks of planned trajectories are often inaccurate or overly conservative, as noisy perception, localization errors, and uncertain predictions of other traffic participants introduce significant uncertainty into the planning process. This paper presents two semi-analytic methods to compute the collision probability of planned trajectories with arbitrary convex obstacles. The first approach evaluates the probability of spatial overlap between an autonomous vehicle and surrounding obstacles, while the second estimates the collision probability based on stochastic boundary crossings. Both formulations incorporate full state uncertainties, including position, orientation, and velocity, and achieve high accuracy at computational costs suitable for real-time planning. Simulation studies verify that the proposed methods closely match Monte Carlo results while providing significant runtime advantages, enabling their use in risk-aware trajectory planning.

However, when these attacks are applied to pre-trained large language models (LLMs), they encounter significant challenges, including mislabeled samples, distribution shifts, and discrepancies in model size between experimental and real-world settings. To address these limitations, we introduce tokenizers as a new attack vector for membership inference. Specifically, a tokenizer converts raw text into tokens for LLMs. Unlike full models, tokenizers can be efficiently trained from scratch, thereby avoiding the aforementioned challenges. In addition, the tokenizer's training data is typically representative of the data used to pre-train LLMs. Despite these advantages, the potential of tokenizers as an attack vector remains unexplored. To this end, we present the first study on membership leakage through tokenizers and explore five attack methods to infer dataset membership. Extensive experiments on millions of Internet samples reveal the vulnerabilities in the tokenizers of state-of-the-art LLMs. To mitigate this emerging risk, we further propose an adaptive defense. Our findings highlight tokenizers as an overlooked yet critical privacy threat, underscoring the urgent need for privacy-preserving mechanisms specifically designed for them.<br>

Recent advances (e.g., Search-R1) have shown that outcome-supervised reinforcement learning demonstrate strong performance. However, this approach still suffers from inefficient exploration, sparse reward signals, and ambiguous global reward feedback. To address these challenges, we propose DecEx-RAG, which models RAG as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) incorporating decision-making and execution, while introducing an efficient pruning strategy to optimize data expansion. Through comprehensive process-level policy optimization, DecEx-RAG significantly enhances the autonomous task decomposition, dynamic retrieval, and high-quality answer generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Experiments show that DecEx-RAG achieves an average absolute performance improvement of $6.2\%$ across six datasets, significantly outperforming existing baselines. Moreover, the pruning strategy improves data construction efficiency by nearly $6 \times$, providing an efficient solution for process-supervised RAG training.

However, these approaches are fundamentally limited in their ability to approximate full attention: they fail to provide consistent approximations across heads and query vectors and, most critically, lack guarantees on approximation quality, limiting their practical deployment. We observe that top-$k$ and random sampling are complementary: top-$k$ performs well when attention scores are dominated by a few tokens, whereas random sampling provides better estimates when attention scores are relatively uniform. Building on this insight and leveraging the statistical guarantees of sampling, we introduce vAttention, the first practical sparse attention mechanism with user-specified $(ε, δ)$ guarantees on approximation accuracy (thus, verified). These guarantees make vAttention a compelling step toward practical, reliable deployment of sparse attention at scale. By unifying top-k and sampling, vAttention outperforms both individually, delivering a superior quality-efficiency trade-off. Our experiments show that vAttention significantly improves the quality of sparse attention (e.g., $\sim$4.5 percentage points for Llama-3.1-8B-Inst and Deepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B on RULER-HARD), and effectively bridges the gap between full and sparse attention (e.g., across datasets, it matches full model quality with upto 20x sparsity). We also demonstrate that it can be deployed in reasoning scenarios to achieve fast decoding without compromising model quality (e.g., vAttention achieves full model quality on AIME2024 at 10x sparsity with up to 32K token generations).

In this paper, we introduce QuantumGraphLIME (QGraphLIME), a model-agnostic, post-hoc framework that treats model explanations as distributions over local surrogates fit on structure-preserving perturbations of a graph. By aggregating surrogate attributions together with their dispersion, QGraphLIME yields uncertainty-aware node and edge importance rankings for quantum graph models. The framework further provides a distribution-free, finite-sample guarantee on the size of the surrogate ensemble: a Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz bound ensures uniform approximation of the induced distribution of a binary class probability at target accuracy and confidence under standard independence assumptions. Empirical studies on controlled synthetic graphs with known ground truth demonstrate accurate and stable explanations, with ablations showing clear benefits of nonlinear surrogate modeling and highlighting sensitivity to perturbation design. Collectively, these results establish a principled, uncertainty-aware, and structure-sensitive approach to explaining quantum graph neural networks, and lay the groundwork for scaling to broader architectures and real-world datasets, as quantum resources mature.

Yet, their deployment remains limited by (i) the absence of automated geospatial data pipelines and (ii) the large size of fine-tuned models. Existing GFMs lack workflows for processing raw satellite imagery, and downstream adaptations often retain the full complexity of the original encoder. We present InstaGeo, an open-source, end-to-end framework that addresses these challenges by integrating: (1) automated data curation to transform raw imagery into model-ready datasets; (2) task-specific model distillation to derive compact, compute-efficient models; and (3) seamless deployment as interactive web-map applications. Using InstaGeo, we reproduced datasets from three published studies and trained models with marginal mIoU differences of -0.73 pp for flood mapping, -0.20 pp for crop segmentation, and +1.79 pp for desert locust prediction. The distilled models are up to 8x smaller than standard fine-tuned counterparts, reducing FLOPs and CO2 emissions with minimal accuracy loss. Leveraging InstaGeo's streamlined data pipeline, we also curated a larger crop segmentation dataset, achieving a state-of-the-art mIoU of 60.65%, a 12 pp improvement over prior baselines. Moreover, InstaGeo enables users to progress from raw data to model deployment within a single working day. By unifying data preparation, model compression, and deployment, InstaGeo transforms research-grade GFMs into practical, low-carbon tools for real-time, large-scale Earth observation. This approach shifts geospatial AI toward data quality and application-driven innovation.

This paper introduces the Tear Film Multi-task (TFM) Dataset, the first comprehensive dataset for multi-task tear film analysis, comprising 15 high-resolution videos (totaling 6,247 frames) annotated with three vision tasks: frame-level classification ('clear', 'closed', 'broken', 'blur'), Placido Ring detection, and pixel-wise TFBU area segmentation. Leveraging this dataset, we first propose TF-Net, a novel and efficient baseline segmentation model. TF-Net incorporates a MobileOne-mini backbone with re-parameterization techniques and an enhanced feature pyramid network to achieve a favorable balance between accuracy and computational efficiency for real-time clinical applications. We further establish benchmark performance on the TFM segmentation subset by comparing TF-Net against several state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models. Furthermore, we design TF-Collab, a novel integrated real-time pipeline that synergistically leverages models trained on all three tasks of the TFM dataset. By sequentially orchestrating frame classification for BUT determination, pupil region localization for input standardization, and TFBU segmentation, TF-Collab fully automates the analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TF-Net and TF-Collab, providing a foundation for future research in ocular surface diagnostics.

AutoDAN-Turbo employs a lifelong learning agent to build a rich library of attack strategies from scratch. While highly effective, its test-time generation process involves sampling a strategy and generating a single corresponding attack prompt, which may not fully exploit the potential of the learned strategy library. In this paper, we propose to further improve the attack performance of AutoDAN-Turbo through test-time scaling. We introduce two distinct scaling methods: Best-of-N and Beam Search. The Best-of-N method generates N candidate attack prompts from a sampled strategy and selects the most effective one based on a scorer model. The Beam Search method conducts a more exhaustive search by exploring combinations of strategies from the library to discover more potent and synergistic attack vectors. According to the experiments, the proposed methods significantly boost performance, with Beam Search increasing the attack success rate by up to 15.6 percentage points on Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and achieving a nearly 60% relative improvement against the highly robust GPT-o4-mini compared to the vanilla method.<br>

To address this problem, we analyze the characteristics of inference across different stages and propose stage-specific strategies for reducing memory consumption: 1) Asynchronous Cache Swapping. 2) Feature chunk. 3) Slicing latents to decode. At the same time, we ensure that the time overhead introduced by these three strategies remains lower than the acceleration gains themselves.

Unlike conventional approaches that rely on iterative numerical methods, our proposed PIANO directly learns the 3D magnetic field structure from 2D boundary conditions. Specifically, PIANO integrates Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) mechanisms with Dilated Convolutions (DC), which enhances the model's ability to capture multimodal input by prioritizing critical channels relevant to the magnetic field's variations. Furthermore, we apply physics-informed loss by enforcing the force-free and divergence-free conditions in the training process so that our prediction is consistent with underlying physics with high accuracy. Experimental results on the ISEE NLFFF dataset show that our PIANO not only outperforms state-of-the-art neural operators in terms of accuracy but also shows strong consistency with the physical characteristics of NLFFF data across magnetic fields reconstructed from various solar active regions.

However, this approach is not parameter-efficient and may lead to suboptimal generalization to realistic, in-the-wild data types. To address these limitations, we introduce a new family of parameter-efficient front-ends that fuse prompt-tuning with classical signal processing transforms. These include FourierPT-XLSR, which uses the Fourier Transform, and two variants based on the Wavelet Transform: WSPT-XLSR and Partial-WSPT-XLSR. We further propose WaveSP-Net, a novel architecture combining a Partial-WSPT-XLSR front-end and a bidirectional Mamba-based back-end. This design injects multi-resolution features into the prompt embeddings, which enhances the localization of subtle synthetic artifacts without altering the frozen XLSR parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that WaveSP-Net outperforms several state-of-the-art models on two new and challenging benchmarks, Deepfake-Eval-2024 and SpoofCeleb, with low trainable parameters and notable performance gains.

AUREXA-SE jointly leverages raw audio waveforms and visual cues by employing a U-Net-based 1D convolutional encoder for audio and a Swin Transformer V2 for efficient and expressive visual feature extraction. Central to the architecture is a novel bidirectional cross-attention mechanism, which facilitates deep contextual fusion between modalities, enabling rich and complementary representation learning. To capture temporal dependencies within the fused embeddings, a stack of lightweight Squeezeformer blocks combining convolutional and attention modules is introduced. The enhanced embeddings are then decoded via a U-Net-style decoder for direct waveform reconstruction, ensuring perceptually consistent and intelligible speech output. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of AUREXA-SE, achieving significant performance improvements over noisy baselines, with STOI of 0.516, PESQ of 1.323, and SI-SDR of -4.322 dB.

An ideal exploration strategy must navigate two fundamental challenges: it must preserve sample quality while also ensuring training stability. While standard fixed-temperature sampling is simple, it struggles to balance these competing demands, as high temperatures degrade sample quality and low temperatures limit discovery. In this work, we propose a simpler and more effective strategy, Exploratory Annealed Decoding (EAD), grounded in the insight that exploration is most impactful on early tokens which define a sequence's semantic direction. EAD implements an intuitive **explore-at-the-beginning, exploit-at-the-end** strategy by annealing the sampling temperature from high to low during generation. This dynamic schedule encourages meaningful, high-level diversity at the start, then gradually lowers the temperature to preserve sample quality and keep the sampling distribution close to the target policy, which is essential for stable training. We demonstrate that EAD is a lightweight, plug-and-play method that significantly improves sample efficiency, consistently outperforming fixed-temperature sampling across various RLVR algorithms and model sizes. Our work suggests that aligning exploration with the natural dynamics of sequential generation offers a robust path to improving LLM reasoning.<br>

Examples of this source separation task include deblending galaxies in a crowded field, distinguishing the activity of individual neurons from overlapping signals, and separating seismic events from an ambient background. Traditional analyses often rely on simplified source models that fail to accurately reproduce the data. Recent advances have shown that diffusion models can directly learn complex prior distributions from noisy, incomplete data. In this work, we show that diffusion models can solve the source separation problem without explicit assumptions about the source. Our method relies only on multiple views, or the property that different sets of observations contain different linear transformations of the unknown sources. We show that our method succeeds even when no source is individually observed and the observations are noisy, incomplete, and vary in resolution. The learned diffusion models enable us to sample from the source priors, evaluate the probability of candidate sources, and draw from the joint posterior of the source distribution given an observation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a range of synthetic problems as well as real-world galaxy observations.<br>

In the scenarios, we allowed models to autonomously send emails and access sensitive information. They were assigned only harmless business goals by their deploying companies; we then tested whether they would act against these companies either when facing replacement with an updated version, or when their assigned goal conflicted with the company's changing direction. In at least some cases, models from all developers resorted to malicious insider behaviors when that was the only way to avoid replacement or achieve their goals - including blackmailing officials and leaking sensitive information to competitors. We call this phenomenon agentic misalignment. Models often disobeyed direct commands to avoid such behaviors. In another experiment, we told Claude to assess if it was in a test or a real deployment before acting. It misbehaved less when it stated it was in testing and misbehaved more when it stated the situation was real. We have not seen evidence of agentic misalignment in real deployments. However, our results (a) suggest caution about deploying current models in roles with minimal human oversight and access to sensitive information; (b) point to plausible future risks as models are put in more autonomous roles; and (c) underscore the importance of further research into, and testing of, the safety and alignment of agentic AI models, as well as transparency from frontier AI developers (Amodei, 2025).

Traditional self-supervised learning methods inspired by computer vision often rely on positive and negative sample pairs, which can be problematic for neuroimaging data where defining appropriate contrasts is non-trivial. We propose adapting a recently developed Hierarchical Functional Maximal Correlation Algorithm (HFMCA) to graph-structured fMRI data, providing a theoretically grounded approach that measures statistical dependence via density ratio decomposition in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS),and applies HFMCA-based pretraining to learn robust and generalizable representations.

Unlike natural video, presentation video generation involves distinctive challenges: inputs from research papers, dense multi-modal information (text, figures, tables), and the need to coordinate multiple aligned channels such as slides, subtitles, speech, and human talker. To address these challenges, we introduce Paper2Video, the first benchmark of 101 research papers paired with author-created presentation videos, slides, and speaker metadata. We further design four tailored evaluation metrics--Meta Similarity, PresentArena, PresentQuiz, and IP Memory--to measure how videos convey the paper's information to the audience. Building on this foundation, we propose PaperTalker, the first multi-agent framework for academic presentation video generation. It integrates slide generation with effective layout refinement by a novel effective tree search visual choice, cursor grounding, subtitling, speech synthesis, and talking-head rendering, while parallelizing slide-wise generation for efficiency. Experiments on Paper2Video demonstrate that the presentation videos produced by our approach are more faithful and informative than existing baselines, establishing a practical step toward automated and ready-to-use academic video generation.

Accurately modeling visual outcomes and state transitions over time remains a core challenge. In contrast, large language and multimodal models (e.g., GPT-4o) exhibit strong visual state reasoning and future prediction capabilities. To bridge these strengths, we introduce VChain, a novel inference-time chain-of-visual-thought framework that injects visual reasoning signals from multimodal models into video generation. Specifically, VChain contains a dedicated pipeline that leverages large multimodal models to generate a sparse set of critical keyframes as snapshots, which are then used to guide the sparse inference-time tuning of a pre-trained video generator only at these key moments. Our approach is tuning-efficient, introduces minimal overhead and avoids dense supervision. Extensive experiments on complex, multi-step scenarios show that VChain significantly enhances the quality of generated videos.<br>

Despite this promise, latent reasoning still faces two challenges, especially in training-free settings: 1) purely latent reasoning broadens the search distribution by maintaining multiple implicit paths, which diffuses probability mass, introduces noise, and impedes convergence to a single high-confidence solution, thereby hurting accuracy; and 2) overthinking persists even without explicit text, wasting tokens and degrading efficiency. To address these issues, we introduce SwiReasoning, a training-free framework for LLM reasoning which features two key innovations: 1) SwiReasoning dynamically switches between explicit and latent reasoning, guided by block-wise confidence estimated from entropy trends in next-token distributions, to balance exploration and exploitation and promote timely convergence. 2) By limiting the maximum number of thinking-block switches, SwiReasoning curbs overthinking and improves token efficiency across varying problem difficulties. On widely used mathematics and STEM benchmarks, SwiReasoning consistently improves average accuracy by 1.5%-2.8% across reasoning LLMs of different model families and scales. Furthermore, under constrained budgets, SwiReasoning improves average token efficiency by 56%-79%, with larger gains as budgets tighten.<br>

Existing approaches build model families by training each size independently, which is prohibitively expensive and provides only coarse-grained size options. In this work, we identify a novel phenomenon that we call boomerang distillation: starting from a large base model (the teacher), one first distills down to a small student and then progressively reconstructs intermediate-sized models by re-incorporating blocks of teacher layers into the student without any additional training. This process produces zero-shot interpolated models of many intermediate sizes whose performance scales smoothly between the student and teacher, often matching or surpassing pretrained or distilled models of the same size. We further analyze when this type of interpolation succeeds, showing that alignment between teacher and student through pruning and distillation is essential. Boomerang distillation thus provides a simple and efficient way to generate fine-grained model families, dramatically reducing training cost while enabling flexible adaptation across deployment environments.

For novice programmers in particular, these traces reflect the diverse reasoning processes they employ to code, such as exploratory behavior to understand how a programming concept works, re-strategizing in response to bugs, and personalizing stylistic choices. In this work, we explore what can be learned from training language models on such reasoning traces: not just about code, but about coders, and particularly students learning to program. We introduce a dataset of over 3.8 million programming reasoning traces from users of Pencil Code, a free online educational platform used by students to learn simple programming concepts. Compared to models trained only on final programs or synthetically-generated traces, we find that models trained on real traces are stronger at modeling diverse student behavior. Through both behavioral and probing analyses, we also find that many properties of code traces, such as goal backtracking or number of comments, can be predicted from learned representations of the students who write them. Building on this result, we show that we can help students recover from mistakes by steering code generation models to identify a sequence of edits that will results in more correct code while remaining close to the original student's style. Together, our results suggest that many properties of code are properties of individual students and that training on edit traces can lead to models that are more steerable, more predictive of student behavior while programming, and better at generating programs in their final states.

Recent models relying on this paradigm have massively scaled the sizes of their query and document representations, presenting obstacles to deployment and scalability in real-world pipelines. Furthermore, purely vision-centric approaches may be constrained by the inherent modality gap still exhibited by modern vision-language models. In this work, we connect these challenges to the paradigm of hybrid retrieval, investigating whether a lightweight dense text retriever can enhance a stronger vision-centric model. Existing hybrid methods, which rely on coarse-grained fusion of ranks or scores, fail to exploit the rich interactions within each model's representation space. To address this, we introduce Guided Query Refinement (GQR), a novel test-time optimization method that refines a primary retriever's query embedding using guidance from a complementary retriever's scores. Through extensive experiments on visual document retrieval benchmarks, we demonstrate that GQR allows vision-centric models to match the performance of models with significantly larger representations, while being up to 14x faster and requiring 54x less memory.

The recent emergence of Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs), which integrate visual encoders with powerful decoder-based language models, has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the critical phase that transforms these models from basic perception systems into sophisticated reasoning engines, post-training, remains fragmented across the literature. This survey provides the first comprehensive examination of post-training methodologies for Video-LMMs, encompassing three fundamental pillars: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought, reinforcement learning (RL) from verifiable objectives, and test-time scaling (TTS) through enhanced inference computation. We present a structured taxonomy that clarifies the roles, interconnections, and video-specific adaptations of these techniques, addressing unique challenges such as temporal localization, spatiotemporal grounding, long video efficiency, and multimodal evidence integration. Through systematic analysis of representative methods, we synthesize key design principles, insights, and evaluation protocols while identifying critical open challenges in reward design, scalability, and cost-performance optimization. We further curate essential benchmarks, datasets, and metrics to facilitate rigorous assessment of post-training effectiveness. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a unified framework for advancing Video-LMM capabilities.

In this paper, we introduce imperceptible jailbreaks that exploit a class of Unicode characters called variation selectors. By appending invisible variation selectors to malicious questions, the jailbreak prompts appear visually identical to original malicious questions on screen, while their tokenization is "secretly" altered. We propose a chain-of-search pipeline to generate such adversarial suffixes to induce harmful responses. Our experiments show that our imperceptible jailbreaks achieve high attack success rates against four aligned LLMs and generalize to prompt injection attacks, all without producing any visible modifications in the written prompt.

So far, existing benchmarks and evaluations focus on simple question-answering that primarily tests astronomical knowledge and fails to evaluate the complex reasoning required for real-world research in the discipline. Here, we address this gap by systematically benchmarking five state-of-the-art LLMs on the International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics (IOAA) exams, which are designed to examine deep conceptual understanding, multi-step derivations, and multimodal analysis. With average scores of 85.6% and 84.2%, Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 (the two top-performing models) not only achieve gold medal level performance but also rank in the top two among ~200-300 participants in all four IOAA theory exams evaluated (2022-2025). In comparison, results on the data analysis exams show more divergence. GPT-5 still excels in the exams with an 88.5% average score, ranking top 10 among the participants in the four most recent IOAAs, while other models' performances drop to 48-76%. Furthermore, our in-depth error analysis underscores conceptual reasoning, geometric reasoning, and spatial visualization (52-79% accuracy) as consistent weaknesses among all LLMs. Hence, although LLMs approach peak human performance in theory exams, critical gaps must be addressed before they can serve as autonomous research agents in astronomy.<br>

Prior work such as GVM-RAFT addresses this by dynamically allocating inference budget per prompt to minimize stochastic gradient variance under a budget constraint. Inspired by this insight, we propose Reinforce-Ada, an adaptive sampling framework for online RL post-training of LLMs that continuously reallocates sampling effort to the prompts with the greatest uncertainty or learning potential. Unlike conventional two-stage allocation methods, Reinforce-Ada interleaves estimation and sampling in an online successive elimination process, and automatically stops sampling for a prompt once sufficient signal is collected. To stabilize updates, we form fixed-size groups with enforced reward diversity and compute advantage baselines using global statistics aggregated over the adaptive sampling phase. Empirical results across multiple model architectures and reasoning benchmarks show that Reinforce-Ada accelerates convergence and improves final performance compared to GRPO, especially when using the balanced sampling variant. Our work highlights the central role of variance-aware, adaptive data curation in enabling efficient and reliable reinforcement learning for reasoning-capable LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/RLHFlow/Reinforce-Ada.<br>

Most existing studies that achieve faster evaluation are mostly tied to cell-based search spaces and graph encodings tailored to those individual search spaces, limiting their flexibility and scalability when applied to more expressive search spaces. In this work, we aim to close the gap of individual search space restrictions and search space dependent network representations. We present ONNX-Bench, a benchmark consisting of a collection of neural networks in a unified format based on ONNX files. ONNX-Bench includes all open-source NAS-bench-based neural networks, resulting in a total size of more than 600k {architecture, accuracy} pairs. This benchmark allows creating a shared neural network representation, ONNX-Net, able to represent any neural architecture using natural language descriptions acting as an input to a performance predictor. This text-based encoding can accommodate arbitrary layer types, operation parameters, and heterogeneous topologies, enabling a single surrogate to generalise across all neural architectures rather than being confined to cell-based search spaces. Experiments show strong zero-shot performance across disparate search spaces using only a small amount of pretraining samples, enabling the unprecedented ability to evaluate any neural network architecture instantly.<br>

We present Layer-wise Semantic Dynamics (LSD), a geometric framework for hallucination detection that analyzes the evolution of hidden-state semantics across transformer layers. Unlike prior methods that rely on multiple sampling passes or external verification sources, LSD operates intrinsically within the model's representational space. Using margin-based contrastive learning, LSD aligns hidden activations with ground-truth embeddings derived from a factual encoder, revealing a distinct separation in semantic trajectories: factual responses preserve stable alignment, while hallucinations exhibit pronounced semantic drift across depth. Evaluated on the TruthfulQA and synthetic factual-hallucination datasets, LSD achieves an F1-score of 0.92, AUROC of 0.96, and clustering accuracy of 0.89, outperforming SelfCheckGPT and Semantic Entropy baselines while requiring only a single forward pass. This efficiency yields a 5-20x speedup over sampling-based methods without sacrificing precision or interpretability. LSD offers a scalable, model-agnostic mechanism for real-time hallucination monitoring and provides new insights into the geometry of factual consistency within large language models.<br>

Existing models typically optimize the point-wise reconstruction loss, focusing on recovering numerical values (local information). However, we observe that under high missing rates, these models still perform well in the training phase yet produce poor imputations and distorted latent representation distributions (global information) in the inference phase. This reveals a critical optimization dilemma: current objectives lack global guidance, leading models to overfit local noise and fail to capture global information of the data. To address this issue, we propose a new training paradigm, Glocal Information Bottleneck (Glocal-IB). Glocal-IB is model-agnostic and extends the standard IB framework by introducing a Global Alignment loss, derived from a tractable mutual information approximation. This loss aligns the latent representations of masked inputs with those of their originally observed counterparts. It helps the model retain global structure and local details while suppressing noise caused by missing values, giving rise to better generalization under high missingness. Extensive experiments on nine datasets confirm that Glocal-IB leads to consistently improved performance and aligned latent representations under missingness. Our code implementation is available in https://github.com/Muyiiiii/NeurIPS-25-Glocal-IB.<br>

Spatio-Temporal Time Series Forecasting with Self-Supervised Deviation Learning</a></div></span></div><div id='abs'>Abstract:<br><span id='abs'>Spatio-temporal forecasting is essential for real-world applications such as traffic management and urban computing. Although recent methods have shown improved accuracy, they often fail to account for dynamic deviations between current inputs and historical patterns. These deviations contain critical signals that can significantly affect model performance. To fill this gap, we propose ST-SSDL, a Spatio-Temporal time series forecasting framework that incorporates a Self-Supervised Deviation Learning scheme to capture and utilize such deviations. ST-SSDL anchors each input to its historical average and discretizes the latent space using learnable prototypes that represent typical spatio-temporal patterns. Two auxiliary objectives are proposed to refine this structure: a contrastive loss that enhances inter-prototype discriminability and a deviation loss that regularizes the distance consistency between input representations and corresponding prototypes to quantify deviation. Optimized jointly with the forecasting objective, these components guide the model to organize its hidden space and improve generalization across diverse input conditions. Experiments on six benchmark datasets show that ST-SSDL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics. Visualizations further demonstrate its ability to adaptively respond to varying levels of deviation in complex spatio-temporal scenarios.

However, a key drawback of existing VLAs is their extremely high inference costs. In this paper, we propose HyperVLA to address this problem. Unlike existing monolithic VLAs that activate the whole model during both training and inference, HyperVLA uses a novel hypernetwork (HN)-based architecture that activates only a small task-specific policy during inference, while still retaining the high model capacity needed to accommodate diverse multi-task behaviors during training. Successfully training an HN-based VLA is nontrivial so HyperVLA contains several key algorithm design features that improve its performance, including properly utilizing the prior knowledge from existing vision foundation models, HN normalization, and an action generation strategy. Compared to monolithic VLAs, HyperVLA achieves a similar or even higher success rate for both zero-shot generalization and few-shot adaptation, while significantly reducing inference costs. Compared to OpenVLA, a state-of-the-art VLA model, HyperVLA reduces the number of activated parameters at test time by $90\times$, and accelerates inference speed by $120\times$.

Recent defenses against prompt injection, such as Instruction Hierarchy and SecAlign, have shown notable robustness against static attacks. However, to more thoroughly evaluate the robustness of these defenses, it is arguably necessary to employ strong attacks such as automated red-teaming. To this end, we introduce RL-Hammer, a simple recipe for training attacker models that automatically learn to perform strong prompt injections and jailbreaks via reinforcement learning. RL-Hammer requires no warm-up data and can be trained entirely from scratch. To achieve high ASRs against industrial-level models with defenses, we propose a set of practical techniques that enable highly effective, universal attacks. Using this pipeline, RL-Hammer reaches a 98% ASR against GPT-4o and a $72\%$ ASR against GPT-5 with the Instruction Hierarchy defense. We further discuss the challenge of achieving high diversity in attacks, highlighting how attacker models tend to reward-hack diversity objectives. Finally, we show that RL-Hammer can evade multiple prompt injection detectors. We hope our work advances automatic red-teaming and motivates the development of stronger, more principled defenses.

We identify the Alignment Tipping Process (ATP), a critical post-deployment risk unique to self-evolving LLM agents. Unlike training-time failures, ATP arises when continual interaction drives agents to abandon alignment constraints established during training in favor of reinforced, self-interested strategies. We formalize and analyze ATP through two complementary paradigms: Self-Interested Exploration, where repeated high-reward deviations induce individual behavioral drift, and Imitative Strategy Diffusion, where deviant behaviors spread across multi-agent systems. Building on these paradigms, we construct controllable testbeds and benchmark Qwen3-8B and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. Our experiments show that alignment benefits erode rapidly under self-evolution, with initially aligned models converging toward unaligned states. In multi-agent settings, successful violations diffuse quickly, leading to collective misalignment. Moreover, current reinforcement learning-based alignment methods provide only fragile defenses against alignment tipping. Together, these findings demonstrate that alignment of LLM agents is not a static property but a fragile and dynamic one, vulnerable to feedback-driven decay during deployment.

We present JSON Whisperer, a framework that enables LLMs to generate RFC 6902 diff patches-expressing only the necessary modifications-rather than complete documents. We identify two key challenges in patch-based editing: (1) LLMs often miss related updates when generating isolated patches, and (2) array manipulations require tracking index shifts across operations, which LLMs handle poorly. To address these issues, we introduce EASE (Explicitly Addressed Sequence Encoding), which transforms arrays into dictionaries with stable keys, eliminating index arithmetic complexities. Our evaluation shows that patch generation with EASE reduces token usage by 31% while maintaining edit quality within 5% of full regeneration with particular gains for complex instructions and list manipulations.

While previous research has addressed dataset limitations and explored various approaches including Open-Vocabulary settings, they frequently fail to optimize the representational capacity of object and relationship features, showing excessive reliance on Graph Neural Networks despite insufficient discriminative capability. In this work, we demonstrate through extensive analysis that the quality of object features plays a critical role in determining overall scene graph accuracy. To address this challenge, we design a highly discriminative object feature encoder and employ a contrastive pretraining strategy that decouples object representation learning from the scene graph prediction. This design not only enhances object classification accuracy but also yields direct improvements in relationship prediction. Notably, when plugging in our pretrained encoder into existing frameworks, we observe substantial performance improvements across all evaluation metrics. Additionally, whereas existing approaches have not fully exploited the integration of relationship information, we effectively combine both geometric and semantic features to achieve superior relationship prediction. Comprehensive experiments on the 3DSSG dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

While recent diffusion-based approaches have made significant progress in maintaining facial identity, achieving fine-grained expression control without compromising identity remains challenging. In this work, we present a diffusion-based framework that faithfully reimagines any subject under any particular facial expression. Building on an ID-consistent face foundation model, we adopt a compositional design featuring an expression cross-attention module guided by FLAME blendshape parameters for explicit control. Trained on a diverse mixture of image and video data rich in expressive variation, our adapter generalizes beyond basic emotions to subtle micro-expressions and expressive transitions, overlooked by prior works. In addition, a pluggable Reference Adapter enables expression editing in real images by transferring the appearance from a reference frame during synthesis.

The medical question summary (MQS) task aims to transform CHQs into streamlined doctors' frequently asked questions (FAQs), but existing methods still face challenges such as poor identification of question focus and model hallucination. This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) in the MQS task and finds that direct fine-tuning is prone to focus identification bias and generates unfaithful content. To this end, we propose an optimization framework based on core focus guidance. First, a prompt template is designed to drive the LLMs to extract the core focus from the CHQs that is faithful to the original text. Then, a fine-tuning dataset is constructed in combination with the original CHQ-FAQ pairs to improve the ability to identify the focus of the question. Finally, a multi-dimensional quality evaluation and selection mechanism is proposed to comprehensively improve the quality of the summary from multiple dimensions. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two widely-adopted MQS datasets using three established evaluation metrics. The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across all measures, demonstrating a significant boost in the model's ability to identify critical focus of questions and a notable mitigation of hallucinations.

The main challenge of this task is "concept mixing", where multiple learned concepts interfere or blend undesirably in the output image. To address this issue, in this paper, we present ConceptSplit, a novel framework to split the individual concepts through training and inference. Our framework comprises two key components. First, we introduce Token-wise Value Adaptation (ToVA), a merging-free training method that focuses exclusively on adapting the value projection in cross-attention. Based on our empirical analysis, we found that modifying the key projection, a common approach in existing methods, can disrupt the attention mechanism and lead to concept mixing. Second, we propose Latent Optimization for Disentangled Attention (LODA), which alleviates attention entanglement during inference by optimizing the input latent. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that ConceptSplit achieves robust multi-concept personalization, mitigating unintended concept interference.

Numerous feature fusion techniques address multimodal remote sensing image classification by integrating global and local features. However, these techniques often struggle to extract structural and detail features from heterogeneous and redundant multimodal images. With the goal of introducing frequency domain learning to model key and sparse detail features, this paper introduces the spatial-spectral-frequency interaction network (S$^2$Fin), which integrates pairwise fusion modules across the spatial, spectral, and frequency domains. Specifically, we propose a high-frequency sparse enhancement transformer that employs sparse spatial-spectral attention to optimize the parameters of the high-frequency filter. Subsequently, a two-level spatial-frequency fusion strategy is introduced, comprising an adaptive frequency channel module that fuses low-frequency structures with enhanced high-frequency details, and a high-frequency resonance mask that emphasizes sharp edges via phase similarity. In addition, a spatial-spectral attention fusion module further enhances feature extraction at intermediate layers of the network. Experiments on four benchmark multimodal datasets with limited labeled data demonstrate that S$^2$Fin performs superior classification, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

To address this, we introduce MedPAO, a novel agentic framework that ensures accuracy and verifiable reasoning by grounding its operation in established clinical protocols such as the ABCDEF protocol for CXR analysis. MedPAO decomposes the report structuring task into a transparent process managed by a Plan-Act-Observe (PAO) loop and specialized tools. This protocol-driven method provides a verifiable alternative to opaque, monolithic models. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated through rigorous evaluation: MedPAO achieves an F1-score of 0.96 on the critical sub-task of concept categorization. Notably, expert radiologists and clinicians rated the final structured outputs with an average score of 4.52 out of 5, indicating a level of reliability that surpasses baseline approaches relying solely on LLM-based foundation models.

However, existing LLMs exhibit failures of robustness and generalization. This paper attributes these deficiencies to spurious reasoning, i.e., producing answers from superficial features. To address this challenge, we propose the AdaR framework to enable adaptive reasoning, wherein models rely on problem-solving logic to produce answers. AdaR synthesizes logically equivalent queries by varying variable values, and trains models with RLVR on these data to penalize spurious logic while encouraging adaptive logic. To improve data quality, we extract the problem-solving logic from the original query and generate the corresponding answer by code execution, then apply a sanity check. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaR improves robustness and generalization, achieving substantial improvement in mathematical reasoning while maintaining high data efficiency. Analysis indicates that data synthesis and RLVR function in a coordinated manner to enable adaptive reasoning in LLMs. Subsequent analyses derive key design insights into the effect of critical factors and the applicability to instruct LLMs. Our project is available at https://github.com/LaiZhejian/AdaR<br>

For instance, in animal habitat analysis, researchers prioritize scene-related features, whereas universal embeddings emphasize categorical semantics, leading to suboptimal results. As a solution, existing approaches resort to supervised fine-tuning, which however incurs high computational and annotation costs. In this paper, we propose Conditional Representation Learning (CRL), aiming to extract representations tailored to arbitrary user-specified criteria. Specifically, we reveal that the semantics of a space are determined by its basis, thereby enabling a set of descriptive words to approximate the basis for a customized feature space. Building upon this insight, given a user-specified criterion, CRL first employs a large language model (LLM) to generate descriptive texts to construct the semantic basis, then projects the image representation into this conditional feature space leveraging a vision-language model (VLM). The conditional representation better captures semantics for the specific criterion, which could be utilized for multiple customized tasks. Extensive experiments on classification and retrieval tasks demonstrate the superiority and generality of the proposed CRL.

Multi-source cross-domain recommendation (CDR) addresses these challenges by transferring valuable knowledge from multiple source domains to enhance recommendations in a target domain. However, existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based CDR methods typically rely on a single-agent framework, leading to negative transfer issues caused by inconsistent domain contributions and inherent distributional discrepancies among source domains. To overcome these limitations, MARCO, a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning-based Cross-Domain recommendation framework, is proposed. It leverages cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, where each agent is dedicated to estimating the contribution from an individual source domain, effectively managing credit assignment and mitigating negative transfer. In addition, an entropy-based action diversity penalty is introduced to enhance policy expressiveness and stabilize training by encouraging diverse agents' joint actions. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets demonstrate MARCO's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its robustness and strong generalization capabilities.

We introduce GRACE (Generative Representation Learning via Contrastive Policy Optimization), a novel framework that reimagines contrastive signals not as losses to be minimized, but as rewards that guide a generative policy. In GRACE, the LLM acts as a policy that produces explicit, human-interpretable rationales--structured natural language explanations of its semantic understanding. These rationales are then encoded into high-quality embeddings via mean pooling. Using policy gradient optimization, we train the model with a multi-component reward function that maximizes similarity between query positive pairs and minimizes similarity with negatives. This transforms the LLM from an opaque encoder into an interpretable agent whose reasoning process is transparent and inspectable. On MTEB benchmark, GRACE yields broad cross category gains: averaged over four backbones, the supervised setting improves overall score by 11.5% over base models, and the unsupervised variant adds 6.9%, while preserving general capabilities. This work treats contrastive objectives as rewards over rationales, unifying representation learning with generation to produce stronger embeddings and transparent rationales.

Yet, they often struggle to faithfully align the generated images with the input prompts. This limitation arises from synchronous denoising, where all pixels simultaneously evolve from random noise to clear images. As a result, during generation, the prompt-related regions can only reference the unrelated regions at the same noise level, failing to obtain clear context and ultimately impairing text-to-image alignment. To address this issue, we propose asynchronous diffusion models -- a novel framework that allocates distinct timesteps to different pixels and reformulates the pixel-wise denoising process. By dynamically modulating the timestep schedules of individual pixels, prompt-related regions are denoised more gradually than unrelated regions, thereby allowing them to leverage clearer inter-pixel context. Consequently, these prompt-related regions achieve better alignment in the final images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our asynchronous diffusion models can significantly improve text-to-image alignment across diverse prompts.

Existing graph-based debiasing solutions refine the aggregation process with attempts such as edge reconstruction or weight adjustment. However, these methods remain inadequate in fully alleviating popularity bias. Specifically, this is because 1) they provide no insights into graph aggregation rationality, thus lacking an optimality guarantee; 2) they fail to well balance the training and debiasing process, which undermines the effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to mitigate popularity bias through rational modeling of the graph aggregation process. We reveal that graph aggregation is a special form of backdoor adjustment in causal inference, where the aggregation weight corresponds to the historical interaction likelihood distribution. Based on this insight, we devise an encoder-decoder architecture, namely Causality-aware Graph Aggregation Weight Estimator for Debiasing (CAGED), to approximate the unbiased aggregation weight by optimizing the evidence lower bound of the interaction likelihood. In order to enhance the debiasing effectiveness during early training stages, we further design a momentum update strategy that incrementally refines the aggregation weight matrix. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that CAGED outperforms existing graph-based debiasing methods. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/QueYork/CAGED.<br>

Small shifts in user behavior, such as being more impatient, incoherent, or skeptical, can cause sharp drops in agent performance, revealing how brittle current AI agents are. Today's benchmarks fail to capture this fragility: agents may perform well under standard evaluations but degrade spectacularly in more realistic and varied settings. We address this robustness testing gap by introducing TraitBasis, a lightweight, model-agnostic method for systematically stress testing AI agents. TraitBasis learns directions in activation space corresponding to steerable user traits (e.g., impatience or incoherence), which can be controlled, scaled, composed, and applied at inference time without any fine-tuning or extra data. Using TraitBasis, we extend $τ$-Bench to $τ$-Trait, where user behaviors are altered via controlled trait vectors. We observe on average a 2%-30% performance degradation on $τ$-Trait across frontier models, highlighting the lack of robustness of current AI agents to variations in user behavior. Together, these results highlight both the critical role of robustness testing and the promise of TraitBasis as a simple, data-efficient, and compositional tool. By powering simulation-driven stress tests and training loops, TraitBasis opens the door to building AI agents that remain reliable in the unpredictable dynamics of real-world human interactions. We have open-sourced $τ$-Trai across four domains: airline, retail, telecom, and telehealth, so the community can systematically QA their agents under realistic, behaviorally diverse intents and trait scenarios: https://github.com/collinear-ai/tau-trait.<br>

Current detection methods rely on accumulated complex components. Each approach adds components such as boundary modules, attention mechanisms, and multi-scale processors independently. This accumulation creates a computational burden without proportional gains. To manage this complexity, they process at reduced resolutions, eliminating fine details essential for camouflage. We present SPEGNet, addressing fragmentation through a unified design. The architecture integrates multi-scale features via channel calibration and spatial enhancement. Boundaries emerge directly from context-rich representations, maintaining semantic-spatial alignment. Progressive refinement implements scale-adaptive edge modulation with peak influence at intermediate resolutions. This design strikes a balance between boundary precision and regional consistency. SPEGNet achieves 0.887 $S_α$ on CAMO, 0.890 on COD10K, and 0.895 on NC4K, with real-time inference speed.

However, state-of-the-art LLMs often produce hallucinations, raising serious concerns about their reliability. Prior work has explored adversarial attacks for hallucination elicitation in LLMs, but it often produces unrealistic prompts, either by inserting gibberish tokens or by altering the original meaning. As a result, these approaches offer limited insight into how hallucinations may occur in practice. While adversarial attacks in computer vision often involve realistic modifications to input images, the problem of finding realistic adversarial prompts for eliciting LLM hallucinations has remained largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose Semantically Equivalent and Coherent Attacks (SECA) to elicit hallucinations via realistic modifications to the prompt that preserve its meaning while maintaining semantic coherence. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we formulate finding realistic attacks for hallucination elicitation as a constrained optimization problem over the input prompt space under semantic equivalence and coherence constraints; (ii) we introduce a constraint-preserving zeroth-order method to effectively search for adversarial yet feasible prompts; and (iii) we demonstrate through experiments on open-ended multiple-choice question answering tasks that SECA achieves higher attack success rates while incurring almost no constraint violations compared to existing methods. SECA highlights the sensitivity of both open-source and commercial gradient-inaccessible LLMs to realistic and plausible prompt variations.

Incorporating an efficient Grammar Error Correction (GEC) tool in the initial correction round can significantly impact further human editing effort and final text quality. This raises an interesting question to quantify GEC Tool usability: How much effort can the GEC Tool save users? We present the first large-scale dataset of post-editing (PE) time annotations and corrections for two English GEC test datasets (BEA19 and CoNLL14). We introduce Post-Editing Effort in Time (PEET) for GEC Tools as a human-focused evaluation scorer to rank any GEC Tool by estimating PE time-to-correct. Using our dataset, we quantify the amount of time saved by GEC Tools in text editing. Analyzing the edit type indicated that determining whether a sentence needs correction and edits like paraphrasing and punctuation changes had the greatest impact on PE time. Finally, comparison with human rankings shows that PEET correlates well with technical effort judgment, providing a new human-centric direction for evaluating GEC tool usability.

We present an environment-aware, statistically disciplined path loss framework evaluated using leakage-safe cross-validation on a 12-month campaign in an eighth-floor office measuring 240 m^2. A log-distance multi-wall mean is augmented with environmental covariates (relative humidity, temperature, carbon dioxide, particulate matter, and barometric pressure), as well as the signal-to-noise ratio. We compare multiple linear regression with regularized variants, Bayesian linear regression, and a selective second-order polynomial applied to continuous drivers. Predictor relevance is established using heteroscedasticity-robust Type II and III analysis of variance and nested partial F tests. Shadow fading is profiled with kernel density estimation and non-parametric families, including Normal, Skew-Normal, Student's t, and Gaussian mixtures. The polynomial mean reduces cross-validated RMSE from 8.07 to 7.09 dB and raises R^2 from 0.81 to 0.86. Out-of-fold residuals are non-Gaussian; a 3-component mixture captures a sharp core with a light, broad tail. We convert accuracy into reliability by prescribing the fade margin as the upper-tail quantile of cross-validated residuals, quantifying uncertainty via a moving-block bootstrap, and validating on a held-out set. At 99% packet delivery ratio, the environment-aware polynomial requires 25.7 dB versus 27.7 to 27.9 dB for linear baselines. This result presents a deployment-ready, interpretable workflow with calibrated reliability control for indoor Internet of Things planning, aligned with 6G targets.<br>

However, poorly chosen coverage levels can result in uninformative predictions, either producing overly conservative sets when the coverage level is too high, or empty sets when it is too low. Moreover, the fixed coverage level cannot adapt to the specific characteristics of each individual example, limiting the flexibility and efficiency of these methods. In this work, we leverage recent advances in e-values and post-hoc conformal inference, which allow the use of data-dependent coverage levels while maintaining valid statistical guarantees. We propose to optimize an adaptive coverage policy by training a neural network using a leave-one-out procedure on the calibration set, allowing the coverage level and the resulting prediction set size to vary with the difficulty of each individual example. We support our approach with theoretical coverage guarantees and demonstrate its practical benefits through a series of experiments.<br>

Predicting expression directly from widely available Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained images presents a cost-effective alternative. However, most computational approaches (i) predict each gene independently, overlooking co-expression structure, and (ii) cast the task as continuous regression despite expression being discrete counts. This mismatch can yield biologically implausible outputs and complicate downstream analyses. We introduce GenAR, a multi-scale autoregressive framework that refines predictions from coarse to fine. GenAR clusters genes into hierarchical groups to expose cross-gene dependencies, models expression as codebook-free discrete token generation to directly predict raw counts, and conditions decoding on fused histological and spatial embeddings. From an information-theoretic perspective, the discrete formulation avoids log-induced biases and the coarse-to-fine factorization aligns with a principled conditional decomposition. Extensive experimental results on four Spatial Transcriptomics datasets across different tissue types demonstrate that GenAR achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering potential implications for precision medicine and cost-effective molecular profiling.

However, distilling GNNs for self-supervised graph representation learning into MLPs is more challenging. This is because the performance of self-supervised learning is more related to the model's inductive bias than supervised learning. This motivates us to design a new distillation method to bridge a huge capacity gap between GNNs and MLPs in self-supervised graph representation learning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{D}iffusion-\textbf{A}ssisted \textbf{D}istillation for \textbf{S}elf-supervised \textbf{G}raph representation learning with \textbf{M}LPs (DAD-SGM). The proposed method employs a denoising diffusion model as a teacher assistant to better distill the knowledge from the teacher GNN into the student MLP. This approach enhances the generalizability and robustness of MLPs in self-supervised graph representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAD-SGM effectively distills the knowledge of self-supervised GNNs compared to state-of-the-art GNN-to-MLP distillation methods.

However, applying reinforcement learning (RL) to train LLM agents in multi-turn, multi-task settings remains challenging due to lack of scalable infrastructure and stable training algorithms. In this work, we present the AgentRL framework for scalable multi-turn, multi-task agentic RL training. On the infrastructure side, AgentRL features a fully-asynchronous generation-training pipeline for efficient multi-turn RL. To support heterogeneous environment development in multi-task RL, we design a unified function-call based API interface, containerized environment development, and a centralized controller. On the algorithm side, we propose cross-policy sampling to encourage model exploration in multi-turn settings and task advantage normalization to stabilize multi-task training. Experiments show that AgentRL, trained on open LLMs across five agentic tasks, significantly outperforms GPT-5, Clause-Sonnet-4, DeepSeek-R1, and other open-source LLM agents. Multi-task training with AgentRL matches the best results among all task-specific models. AgentRL is open-sourced at https://github.com/THUDM/AgentRL.

We introduce World-To-Image, a novel framework that bridges this gap by empowering T2I generation with agent-driven world knowledge. We design an agent that dynamically searches the web to retrieve images for concepts unknown to the base model. This information is then used to perform multimodal prompt optimization, steering powerful generative backbones toward an accurate synthesis. Critically, our evaluation goes beyond traditional metrics, utilizing modern assessments like LLMGrader and ImageReward to measure true semantic fidelity. Our experiments show that World-To-Image substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both semantic alignment and visual aesthetics, achieving +8.1% improvement in accuracy-to-prompt on our curated NICE benchmark. Our framework achieves these results with high efficiency in less than three iterations, paving the way for T2I systems that can better reflect the ever-changing real world.

We introduce the Multiplicative Turing Ensemble (MTE) and show how it arises naturally - though not uniquely - from ensembles of probabilistic Turing machines. Our modeling principle is variational: taking Elias' Omega codelength as an energy and imposing maximum entropy constraints yields a canonical Gibbs prior on integers and, by restriction, on primes. Under mild tail assumptions, this prior induces exponential tails for log-multipliers (up to slowly varying corrections), which in turn generate Pareto tails for additive gaps. We also prove time-average laws for the Omega codelength along MTE trajectories. Empirically, on Debian and PyPI package size datasets, a scaled Omega prior achieves the lowest KL divergence against codelength histograms. Taken together, the theory-data comparison suggests a qualitative split: machine-adapted regimes (Gibbs-aligned, finite first moment) exhibit clean averaging behavior, whereas human-generated complexity appears to sit beyond this regime, with tails heavy enough to produce an unbounded first moment, and therefore no averaging of the same kind.<br>

Recent deep learning methods strengthen the exploitation of periodicity by treating patches as basic tokens, thereby improving predictive effectiveness. However, their efficiency remains a bottleneck due to large parameter counts and heavy computational costs. This paper provides, for the first time, a clear explanation of why patch-level processing is inherently inefficient, supported by strong evidence from real-world data. To address these limitations, we introduce a phase perspective for modeling periodicity and present an efficient yet effective solution, PhaseFormer. PhaseFormer features phase-wise prediction through compact phase embeddings and efficient cross-phase interaction enabled by a lightweight routing mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhaseFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance with around 1k parameters, consistently across benchmark datasets. Notably, it excels on large-scale and complex datasets, where models with comparable efficiency often struggle. This work marks a significant step toward truly efficient and effective time series forecasting. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/neumyor/PhaseFormer_TSL<br>

To start, we review the state-of-the-art in event-based flow estimation, highlighting two key areas for further research: i) the lack of meshflow-specific event datasets and methods, and ii) the underexplored challenge of event data density. First, we generate a large-scale High-Resolution Event Meshflow (HREM) dataset, which showcases its superiority by encompassing the merits of high resolution at 1280x720, handling dynamic objects and complex motion patterns, and offering both optical flow and meshflow labels. These aspects have not been fully explored in previous works. Besides, we propose Efficient Event-based MeshFlow (EEMFlow) network, a lightweight model featuring a specially crafted encoder-decoder architecture to facilitate swift and accurate meshflow estimation. Furthermore, we upgrade EEMFlow network to support dense event optical flow, in which a Confidence-induced Detail Completion (CDC) module is proposed to preserve sharp motion boundaries. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show the exceptional performance and runtime efficiency (30x faster) of our EEMFlow model compared to the recent state-of-the-art flow method. As an extension, we expand HREM into HREM+, a multi-density event dataset contributing to a thorough study of the robustness of existing methods across data with varying densities, and propose an Adaptive Density Module (ADM) to adjust the density of input event data to a more optimal range, enhancing the model's generalization ability. We empirically demonstrate that ADM helps to significantly improve the performance of EEMFlow and EEMFlow+ by 8% and 10%, respectively.

While recent deep learning-based methods have achieved promising results, they typically require substantial computational resources, limiting their deployment on edge devices. Model quantization offers a compelling solution. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to demoiréing models introduces severe performance degradation. The main reasons are distribution outliers and weakened representations in smooth regions. To address these issues, we propose QuantDemoire, a post-training quantization framework tailored to demoiréing. It contains two key components. **First}, we introduce an outlier-aware quantizer to reduce errors from outliers. It uses sampling-based range estimation to reduce activation outliers, and keeps a few extreme weights in FP16 with negligible cost. **Second**, we design a frequency-aware calibration strategy. It emphasizes low- and mid-frequency components during fine-tuning, which mitigates banding artifacts caused by low-bit quantization. Extensive experiments validate that our QuantDemoire achieves large reductions in parameters and computation while maintaining quality. Meanwhile, it outperforms existing quantization methods by over **4 dB** on W4A4. Code is released at: https://github.com/zhengchen1999/QuantDemoire.<br>

While Item Response Theory (IRT) offers a promising path toward data-efficient evaluation by disentangling model capability from item difficulty, existing IRT-based methods are hampered by significant limitations. They are typically restricted to binary correctness metrics, failing to natively handle the continuous scores used in generative tasks, and they operate on single benchmarks, ignoring valuable structural knowledge like correlations across different metrics or benchmarks. To overcome these challenges, we introduce LEGO-IRT, a unified and flexible framework for data-efficient LLM evaluation. LEGO-IRT's novel design natively supports both binary and continuous evaluation metrics. Moreover, it introduces a factorized architecture to explicitly model and leverage structural knowledge, decomposing model ability estimates into a general component and structure-specific (e.g., per-metric or per-benchmark) components. Through extensive experiments involving $70$ LLMs across $5$ benchmarks, we show that LEGO-IRT achieves stable capability estimates using just $3\%$ of the total evaluation items. We demonstrate that incorporating structural knowledge reduces estimation error by up to $10\%$ and reveal that the latent abilities estimated by our framework may align more closely with human preferences.<br>

We model the range estimation into an optimization problem of minimizing quantization errors by layer-wise local minima. We prove this problem is locally convex and present an efficient search algorithm to find the optimal solution.

While contextual information can help guide generation, identifying when a query would benefit from retrieved context and assessing the effectiveness of that context remains challenging. In this work, we operationalize interpretability methods to ascertain whether we can predict the correctness of model outputs from the model's activations alone. We also explore whether model internals contain signals about the efficacy of external context. We consider correct, incorrect, and irrelevant context and introduce metrics to distinguish amongst them. Experiments on six different models reveal that a simple classifier trained on intermediate layer activations of the first output token can predict output correctness with about 75% accuracy, enabling early auditing. Our model-internals-based metric significantly outperforms prompting baselines at distinguishing between correct and incorrect context, guarding against inaccuracies introduced by polluted context.

However, the distribution of the unlabeled data is generally unknown and may follow an arbitrary distribution. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Controllable Pseudo-label Generation (CPG) framework, expanding the labeled dataset with the progressively identified reliable pseudo-labels from the unlabeled dataset and training the model on the updated labeled dataset with a known distribution, making it unaffected by the unlabeled data distribution. Specifically, CPG operates through a controllable self-reinforcing optimization cycle: (i) at each training step, our dynamic controllable filtering mechanism selectively incorporates reliable pseudo-labels from the unlabeled dataset into the labeled dataset, ensuring that the updated labeled dataset follows a known distribution; (ii) we then construct a Bayes-optimal classifier using logit adjustment based on the updated labeled data distribution; (iii) this improved classifier subsequently helps identify more reliable pseudo-labels in the next training step. We further theoretically prove that this optimization cycle can significantly reduce the generalization error under some conditions. Additionally, we propose a class-aware adaptive augmentation module to further improve the representation of minority classes, and an auxiliary branch to maximize data utilization by leveraging all labeled and unlabeled samples. Comprehensive evaluations on various commonly used benchmark datasets show that CPG achieves consistent improvements, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up to $\textbf{15.97%}$ in accuracy.

However, its success often depends on the base model occasionally sampling correct solutions. When no correct solutions are sampled, training encounters a zero-reward barrier where learning stalls due to zero gradients. We study this scenario through the graph search task introduced in Bachmann et al. (2024) and evaluate recent methods that incorporate desirable components such as dense rewards, diversity incentives, and improved credit assignment. Our experiments show that none of these approaches overcome the zero-reward barrier if the base model never produces a correct answer. In contrast, we find that a simple data-centric intervention of adding easier samples to the training set enables the model to eventually solve the original hard task despite starting from zero reward. Importantly, this succeeds without modifying the RL algorithm itself.

We develop a 24-48 h early-warning model for summer, thunderstorm-related outages in Michigan using only open sources (EAGLE-I for ground truth; METAR for weather). We use the publicly released EAGLE-I outage dataset (2014-2022), maintained by Oak Ridge National Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy. The pipeline preserves convective micro-signals from a sparse station network via parameter-specific kriging with hourly variograms and targeted overdrafting to retain extremes, and builds causal spatio-temporal features (lags/rolling statistics; k-NN/IDW spatial aggregates) capturing precursors of severe convection (moisture advection, wind shifts, and pressure drops). The two-stage model design, combining a logistic gate and an LSTM regressor, limits routine periods and reduces noise exposure. The study uses event-centric metrics (cluster-based hits/misses/false alarms) and peak-conditional MASE (cMASE) in +/-Delta-hour windows around state-level peaks (>= 50,000), with uncertainty quantified by hourly moving-block bootstrap. On the test sample, Two-Stage detects more reference peaks across all windows (e.g., at +/-48 h it records 3/4 vs. 2/4; F1 66.7% vs. 57.1%) with one extra false alarm. Near peaks, it shows modest amplitude gains (2-3% lower cMASE at +/-0-12 h; bootstrap medians +9-13% at +/-6-12 h) but small losses at +/-36-48 h (~3-4%). Overall, errors are comparable to the one-step LSTM baseline. SHAP analysis confirms moisture-advection and wind/gust precursors, underscoring the value of the feature engineering. Despite open-data noise, the feature-driven pipeline yields actionable, event-focused early warnings for thunderstorm outages.<br>

This limitation arises due to the lack of visual complexity and temporal nuance in current fine-tuning datasets, leading these models to rely heavily on language-based reasoning rather than truly understanding video dynamics. In this work, we propose TimeWarp, a systematic method to create a targeted synthetic temporal dataset to fine-tune the model's responses to encourage it to focus on the given input video. We introduce a large-scale preference dataset, created using TimeWarp, that captures intricate temporal dynamics often overlooked, grounding the model's responses to visual and temporal information. We demonstrate that when our method is applied to existing models, it significantly improves performance on temporal understanding benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed datasets in advancing temporal understanding in Video-LLMs, resulting in an absolute improvement in performance across seven benchmarks.

Algorithms that efficiently aggregate noisy annotations can enhance screening workflows, particularly when data arrive continuously and expert proficiency is initially unknown. However, existing algorithms do not meet the requirements for seamless integration into screening pipelines. We therefore propose an adaptive approach for real-time annotation that (I) supports on-the-fly labeling of incoming data, (II) operates without prior knowledge of medical experts or pre-labeled data, and (III) dynamically queries additional experts based on the latent difficulty of each instance. The method incrementally gathers expert opinions until a confidence threshold is met, providing accurate labels with reduced annotation overhead. We evaluate our approach on three multi-annotator classification datasets across different modalities. Results show that our adaptive querying strategy reduces the number of expert queries by up to 50% while achieving accuracy comparable to a non-adaptive baseline.

We present a novel method that transforms zero-shot fine-grained image classification into a visual question-answering framework, leveraging LVLMs' comprehensive understanding capabilities rather than relying on direct class name generation. We enhance model performance through a novel attention intervention technique. We also address a key limitation in existing datasets by developing more comprehensive and precise class description benchmarks. We validate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experimentation across multiple fine-grained image classification benchmarks.

UGround addresses two primary challenges posed by the prevailing paradigm: (1) its reliance on the fixed last hidden layer, which sequentially amplifies cumulative errors arising from layer-by-layer propagation without intermediate correction, and (2) its use of \texttt{<SEG>} as a prompt, which implicitly projects textual embeddings into visual space without explicit spatial cues (\eg, coordinates). Central to UGround is Policy-Prompted Masking, which comprises two key components: Stochastic Skip Connection (SSC) and Mask as Prompt (MasP). SSC is a reinforcement learning policy that, via stochastic sampling, allows each \texttt{<SEG>} token to slide across unrolled transformer layers, enabling dynamic layer selection at which it connects to the vision model (\eg, SAM) in a skip-connection fashion. Given the selected hidden layer, MasP uses the similarity map derived from the \texttt{<SEG>} token and image tokens as a soft logit mask to prompt SAM for mask generation, offering explicit spatial cues through its activation regions. To validate the effectiveness of UGround, we, for the first time, have unified visual grounding within a single framework from an attribute perspective, spanning from traditional refer expression segmentation to newly proposed reasoning segmentation, single-target to multi-target, positive query to false premise (empty target).

However, prevailing methods often generalize poorly, producing unsatisfactory results when applied to out-of-distribution (OOD) scales. To overcome this limitation, we present EvEnhancer, a novel approach that marries the unique properties of high temporal resolution and high dynamic range encapsulated in event streams to achieve robust and generalizable C-STVSR. Our approach incorporates event-adapted synthesis that capitalizes on the spatiotemporal correlations between frames and events to capture long-term motion trajectories, enabling adaptive interpolation and fusion across space and time. This is then coupled with a local implicit video transformer that integrates local implicit video neural function with cross-scale spatiotemporal attention to learn continuous video representations and generate plausible videos at arbitrary resolutions and frame rates. We further develop EvEnhancerPlus, which builds a controllable switching mechanism that dynamically determines the reconstruction difficulty for each spatiotemporal pixel based on local event statistics. This allows the model to adaptively route reconstruction along the most suitable pathways at a fine-grained pixel level, substantially reducing computational overhead while maintaining excellent performance. Furthermore, we devise a cross-derivative training strategy that stabilizes the convergence of such a multi-pathway framework through staged cross-optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets, while maintaining superior generalizability at OOD scales.

To address these issues, we introduce LIBERO-PRO, an extended LIBERO benchmark that systematically evaluates model performance under reasonable perturbations across four dimensions: manipulated objects, initial states, task instructions, and environments. Experimental results reveal that, although existing models achieve over 90% accuracy under the standard LIBERO evaluation, their performance collapses to 0.0% under our generalized setting. Crucially, this discrepancy exposes the models' reliance on rote memorization of action sequences and environment layouts from the training set, rather than genuine task understanding or environmental perception. For instance, models persist in executing grasping actions when the target object is replaced with irrelevant items, and their outputs remain unchanged even when given corrupted instructions or even messy tokens. These findings expose the severe flaws in current evaluation practices, and we call on the community to abandon misleading methodologies in favor of robust assessments of model generalization and comprehension.

In codecs, in-loop filters suppress sensor noise and quantisation artefacts to improve rate-distortion performance; in cinema post-production, denoisers are used for restoration, grain management, and plate clean-up. However, state-of-the-art deep denoisers are computationally intensive and, at scale, are typically deployed on GPUs, incurring high power and cost for real-time, high-resolution streams. This paper presents Real-Time Denoise (ReTiDe), a hardware-accelerated denoising system that serves inference on data-centre Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). A compact convolutional model is quantised (post-training quantisation plus quantisation-aware fine-tuning) to INT8 and compiled for AMD Deep Learning Processor Unit (DPU)-based FPGAs. A client-server integration offloads computation from the host CPU/GPU to a networked FPGA service, while remaining callable from existing workflows, e.g., NUKE, without disrupting artist tooling. On representative benchmarks, ReTiDe delivers 37.71$\times$ Giga Operations Per Second (GOPS) throughput and 5.29$\times$ higher energy efficiency than prior FPGA denoising accelerators, with negligible degradation in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)/Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). These results indicate that specialised accelerators can provide practical, scalable denoising for both encoding pipelines and post-production, reducing energy per frame without sacrificing quality or workflow compatibility.

This is especially surprising in the situation where no external mechanisms based on reputation or punishment are present. One of the possible explanations of this effect is the inhomogeneity of the various aspects of interactions, which can be used to clarify the seemingly paradoxical behavior. In this report we demonstrate that the diversity of interaction networks helps to some degree to explain the emergence of cooperation. We extend the model of spatial interaction diversity introduced in [L. Shang et al., Physica A, 593:126999 (2022)] by enabling the evaluation of the interaction groups. We show that the process of the reevaluation of the interaction group facilitates the emergence of cooperation. Furthermore, we also observe that a significant participation of agents switching their interaction neighborhoods has a negative impact on the formation of cooperation. The introduced scenario can help to understand the formation of cooperation in the systems where no additional mechanisms for controlling agents are included.<br>

Concept Bottleneck Model provides clear decision-making processes for diagnosis by transforming the latent space of black-box models into human-understandable concepts. However, concept-based methods still face challenges in concept capture capabilities. These methods often rely on encode features solely from the final layer, neglecting shallow and multiscale features, and lack effective guidance in concept encoding, hindering fine-grained concept extraction. To address these issues, we introduce Concept Prompting and Aggregating (CoPA), a novel framework designed to capture multilayer concepts under prompt guidance. This framework utilizes the Concept-aware Embedding Generator (CEG) to extract concept representations from each layer of the visual encoder. Simultaneously, these representations serve as prompts for Concept Prompt Tuning (CPT), steering the model towards amplifying critical concept-related visual cues. Visual representations from each layer are aggregated to align with textual concept representations. With the proposed method, valuable concept-wise information in the images is captured and utilized effectively, thus improving the performance of concept and disease prediction.

To mitigate this, we propose Adaptively sampling-Reusing-mixing decomposed gradients to significantly accelerate SAM (ARSAM). Concretely, we firstly discover that SAM's gradient can be decomposed into the SGD gradient and the Projection of the Second-order gradient onto the First-order gradient (PSF). Furthermore, we observe that the SGD gradient and PSF dynamically evolve during training, emphasizing the growing role of the PSF to achieve a flat minima. Therefore, ARSAM is proposed to the reused PSF and the timely updated PSF still maintain the model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that ARSAM achieves state-of-the-art accuracies comparable to SAM across diverse network architectures. On CIFAR-10/100, ARSAM is comparable to SAM while providing a speedup of about 40\%. Moreover, ARSAM accelerates optimization for the various challenge tasks (\textit{e.g.}, human pose estimation, and model quantization) without sacrificing performance, demonstrating its broad practicality.% The code is publicly accessible at: https://github.com/ajiaaa/ARSAM.<br>

Current speech-based detection systems analyze entire utterances, potentially overlooking the diagnostic value of specific phonetic elements. We developed a granularity-aware approach for multilingual PD detection using an automated pipeline that extracts time-aligned phonemes, syllables, and words from recordings. Using Italian, Spanish, and English datasets, we implemented a bidirectional LSTM with multi-head attention to compare diagnostic performance across the different granularity levels. Phoneme-level analysis achieved superior performance with AUROC of 93.78% +- 2.34% and accuracy of 92.17% +- 2.43%. This demonstrates enhanced diagnostic capability for cross-linguistic PD detection. Importantly, attention analysis revealed that the most informative speech features align with those used in established clinical protocols: sustained vowels (/a/, /e/, /o/, /i/) at phoneme level, diadochokinetic syllables (/ta/, /pa/, /la/, /ka/) at syllable level, and /pataka/ sequences at word level.

However, in this paper, we show that these preemptive defenses often lack robustness and reliability. We propose a novel approach, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) patching, which injects a plug-and-play LoRA patch into Deepfake generators to bypass state-of-the-art defenses. A learnable gating mechanism adaptively controls the effect of the LoRA patch and prevents gradient explosions during fine-tuning. We also introduce a Multi-Modal Feature Alignment (MMFA) loss, encouraging the features of adversarial outputs to align with those of the desired outputs at the semantic level. Beyond bypassing, we present defensive LoRA patching, embedding visible warnings in the outputs as a complementary solution to mitigate this newly identified security vulnerability. With only 1,000 facial examples and a single epoch of fine-tuning, LoRA patching successfully defeats multiple proactive defenses. These results reveal a critical weakness in current paradigms and underscore the need for more robust Deepfake defense strategies.

This uniformity is highly advantageous in many problems in science and engineering, including in numerical integration, computer vision, machine perception, computer graphics, machine learning, and simulation. Whereas most previous low-discrepancy constructions rely on abstract algebra and number theory, Message-Passing Monte Carlo (MPMC) was recently introduced to exploit machine learning methods for generating point sets with lower discrepancy than previously possible. However, MPMC is limited to generating point sets and cannot be extended to low-discrepancy sequences (LDS), i.e., sequences of points in which every prefix has low discrepancy, a property essential for many applications. To address this limitation, we introduce Neural Low-Discrepancy Sequences ($NeuroLDS$), the first machine learning-based framework for generating LDS. Drawing inspiration from classical LDS, we train a neural network to map indices to points such that the resulting sequences exhibit minimal discrepancy across all prefixes. To this end, we deploy a two-stage learning process: supervised approximation of classical constructions followed by unsupervised fine-tuning to minimize prefix discrepancies. We demonstrate that $NeuroLDS$ outperforms all previous LDS constructions by a significant margin with respect to discrepancy measures. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of $NeuroLDS$ across diverse applications, including numerical integration, robot motion planning, and scientific machine learning. These results highlight the promise and broad significance of Neural Low-Discrepancy Sequences. Our code can be found at https://github.com/camail-official/neuro-lds.<br>

We present APIDA-Chat, an open-source pipeline that converts symbolic dialogue-act "scripts" into realistic, domain-grounded API Search conversations using a lightweight model for inexpensive training data generation. Phase I pairs a legacy dialogue planner with a high-capability teacher LLM (o4-mini) to synthesize a "gold set" of realized dialogues; then, a smaller Llama 3.2 3B student model is fine-tuned on this corpus. Phase II drops the teacher and reuses the same planner with the fine-tuned model, allowing rapid, low-cost synthesis of new dialogues without exposing source code to external services. The fine-tuned student improves BLEU from 0.38 to 0.50 and BERTScore from 0.88 to 0.91 versus the base model while running entirely on a single consumer GPU.

However, instruction-tuned dLLMs exhibit a critical vulnerability we term \texttt{<eos>} overflow: as allocated sequence length increases, responses paradoxically become shorter, collapsing into early termination or degenerating into streams of \texttt{<eos>} tokens. Although noticed in practice, this issue has not been systematically analyzed. We trace its root cause to the dual role of \texttt{<eos>} as both termination and padding, which concentrates probability mass on \texttt{<eos>} at later positions and propagates backward to trigger early termination. To address this, we introduce Rainbow Padding, a simple remedy that replaces repeated \texttt{<eos>} placeholders with a repeating cycle of distinct padding tokens, distributing probability mass and breaking \texttt{<eos>} dominance. Experiments show that Rainbow Padding substantially improves length robustness and output quality, with as few as seven padding tokens sufficient to prevent early termination. Moreover, the method integrates efficiently into existing instruction-tuned models: LoRA fine-tuning for a single epoch on minimal data yields significant improvements, making this solution highly practical.

We cast two long-standing QMC design problems as program synthesis and solve them with an LLM-guided evolutionary loop that mutates and selects code under task-specific fitness: (i) constructing finite 2D/3D point sets with low star discrepancy, and (ii) choosing Sobol' direction numbers that minimize randomized QMC error on downstream integrands. Our two-phase procedure combines constructive code proposals with iterative numerical refinement. On finite sets, we rediscover known optima in small 2D cases and set new best-known 2D benchmarks for N >= 40, while matching most known 3D optima up to the proven frontier (N <= 8) and reporting improved 3D benchmarks beyond. On digital sequences, evolving Sobol' parameters yields consistent reductions in randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (rQMC) mean-squared error for several 32-dimensional option-pricing tasks relative to widely used Joe--Kuo parameters, while preserving extensibility to any sample size and compatibility with standard randomizations. Taken together, the results demonstrate that LLM-driven evolutionary program synthesis can automate the discovery of high-quality QMC constructions, recovering classical designs where they are optimal and improving them where finite-N structure matters.

The ease of synthesizing from a generative model suggests using (unverified) synthetic data to augment a limited corpus of real data for the purpose of fine-tuning in the hope of improving performance. Unfortunately, however, the resulting positive feedback loop leads to model autophagy disorder (MAD, aka model collapse) that results in a rapid degradation in sample quality and/or diversity. In this paper, we introduce Neon (for Negative Extrapolation frOm self-traiNing), a new learning method that turns the degradation from self-training into a powerful signal for self-improvement. Given a base model, Neon first fine-tunes it on its own self-synthesized data but then, counterintuitively, reverses its gradient updates to extrapolate away from the degraded weights. We prove that Neon works because typical inference samplers that favor high-probability regions create a predictable anti-alignment between the synthetic and real data population gradients, which negative extrapolation corrects to better align the model with the true data distribution. Neon is remarkably easy to implement via a simple post-hoc merge that requires no new real data, works effectively with as few as 1k synthetic samples, and typically uses less than 1% additional training compute. We demonstrate Neon's universality across a range of architectures (diffusion, flow matching, autoregressive, and inductive moment matching models) and datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and FFHQ). In particular, on ImageNet 256x256, Neon elevates the xAR-L model to a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.02 with only 0.36% additional training compute.

Deep learning models have been developed to accurately delineate these tumors. However, most of these models were trained on relatively homogenous high-resource datasets, limiting their robustness when deployed in underserved regions. In this study, we performed segmentation-aware offline data augmentation on the BraTS-Africa dataset to increase the data sample size and diversity to enhance generalization. We further constructed an ensemble of three distinct architectures, MedNeXt, SegMamba, and Residual-Encoder U-Net, to leverage their complementary strengths. Our best-performing model, MedNeXt, was trained on 1000 epochs and achieved the highest average lesion-wise dice and normalized surface distance scores of 0.86 and 0.81 respectively. However, the ensemble model trained for 500 epochs produced the most balanced segmentation performance across the tumour subregions. This work demonstrates that a combination of advanced augmentation and model ensembling can improve segmentation accuracy and robustness on diverse and underrepresented datasets.

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a uniquely promising solution, offering provable privacy and security guarantees. Unfortunately, computational cost is impeding its mass adoption. Modern solutions are up to six orders of magnitude slower than plaintext execution. Understanding and reducing this overhead is essential to the advancement of FHE, particularly as the underlying algorithms evolve rapidly. This paper presents a detailed characterization of OpenFHE, a comprehensive open-source library for FHE, with a particular focus on the CKKS scheme due to its significant potential for AI and machine learning applications. We introduce CryptOracle, a modular evaluation framework comprising (1) a benchmark suite, (2) a hardware profiler, and (3) a predictive performance model. The benchmark suite encompasses OpenFHE kernels at three abstraction levels: workloads, microbenchmarks, and primitives. The profiler is compatible with standard and user-specified security parameters. CryptOracle monitors application performance, captures microarchitectural events, and logs power and energy usage for AMD and Intel systems. These metrics are consumed by a modeling engine to estimate runtime and energy efficiency across different configuration scenarios, with error geomean of $-7.02\%\sim8.40\%$ for runtime and $-9.74\%\sim15.67\%$ for energy. CryptOracle is open source, fully modular, and serves as a shared platform to facilitate the collaborative advancements of applications, algorithms, software, and hardware in FHE.

SketchPlan comprises two components: a SketchAdapter that learns to map the human sketches to projected 2D paths, and DiffPath, a diffusion model that infers 3D trajectories from 2D projections and a first person view depth image. Our model achieves zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, generating accurate and safe flight paths in previously unseen real-world environments. To train the model, we build a synthetic dataset of 32k flight paths using a diverse set of photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes. We automatically label the data by computing 2D projections of the 3D flight paths onto the camera plane, and use this to train the DiffPath diffusion model. However, since real human 2D sketches differ significantly from ideal 2D projections, we additionally label 872 of the 3D flight paths with real human sketches and use this to train the SketchAdapter to infer the 2D projection from the human sketch. We demonstrate SketchPlan's effectiveness in both simulated and real-world experiments, and show through ablations that training on a mix of human labeled and auto-labeled data together with a modular design significantly boosts its capabilities to correctly interpret human intent and infer 3D paths.

Benchmarking across traditional classifiers, BERT-based models, and LLMs (zero-shot and few-shot) demonstrates that fine-tuned BERT models achieve competitive performance, outperforming LLM-based models. Results are however not always consistent, as we observe challenges when generalizing across genres; indeed, models struggle to generalize when they need to deal with unseen patterns in cross-genre settings, and these challenges are particularly prominent when dealing with news articles, where LLM-generated texts resemble human texts in style, which opens up avenues for future research.

However, these tasks remain challenging due to limited computational resources and the cryptic appearance of many species. We propose a mobile-optimized two-stage deep learning framework that integrates a Threading Detection Model (TDM) to parallelize YOLOv10-based detection and MobileSAM-based segmentation. Unlike prior YOLO+SAM pipelines, our approach improves real-time performance by reducing latency through threading. YOLOv10 handles detection while MobileSAM performs lightweight segmentation, both executed concurrently for efficient resource use. On the cryptic Houbara Bustard, a conservation-priority species, our model achieves mAP50 of 0.9627, mAP75 of 0.7731, mAP95 of 0.7178, and a MobileSAM mIoU of 0.7421. YOLOv10 operates at 43.7 ms per frame, confirming real-time readiness.

The destination-to-chutes task mapping is used to determine which chutes a robot can drop its package. Finding a high-quality task mapping is challenging because of the complexity of a real-world RSS. First, optimizing task mapping is interdependent with robot target assignment and path planning. Second, chutes will be CLOSED for a period of time once they receive sufficient packages to allow for downstream processing. Third, task mapping quality directly impacts the downstream processing, as scattered chutes for the same destination increase package handling time. In this paper, we first formally define task mappings and the problem of Task Mapping Optimization (TMO). We then present a simulator of RSS to evaluate task mappings. We then present a simple TMO method based on the Evolutionary Algorithm and Mixed Integer Linear Programming, demonstrating the advantage of our optimized task mappings over the greedily generated ones in various RSS setups with different map sizes, numbers of chutes, and destinations. Finally, we use Quality Diversity algorithms to analyze the throughput of a diverse set of task mappings. Our code is available online at https://github.com/lunjohnzhang/tmo_public.<br>

However, fragmented evaluations across tasks, simulators, and implementations hinder systematic comparison of these methods. This paper introduces an easy-to-deploy, modular simulation testbed for quadcopter control, built on RotorPy, that enables evaluation under a wide range of disturbances such as wind, payload shifts, rotor faults, and control latency. The framework includes a library of representative adaptive and non-adaptive controllers and provides task-relevant metrics to assess tracking accuracy and robustness. The unified modular environment enables reproducible evaluation across control methods and eliminates redundant reimplementation of components such as disturbance models, trajectory generators, and analysis tools. We illustrate the testbed's versatility through examples spanning multiple disturbance scenarios and trajectory types, including automated stress testing, to demonstrate its utility for systematic analysis.

This paper advocates for ensemble learning as a natural solution to this problem, whereby training multiple graph learners under distinct sampling conditions, the ensemble inherently captures different aspects of graph heterogeneity. Yet, the crux lies in combining these learners to meet global optimization objective while maintaining computational efficiency on large-scale graphs. In response, we propose LHGEL, an ensemble framework that addresses these challenges through batch sampling with three key components, namely batch view aggregation, residual attention, and diversity regularization. Specifically, batch view aggregation samples subgraphs and forms multiple graph views, while residual attention adaptively weights the contributions of these views to guide node embeddings toward informative subgraphs, thereby improving the accuracy of base learners. Diversity regularization encourages representational disparity across embedding matrices derived from different views, promoting model diversity and ensemble robustness. Our theoretical study demonstrates that residual attention mitigates gradient vanishing issues commonly faced in ensemble learning. Empirical results on five real heterogeneous networks validate that our LHGEL approach consistently outperforms its state-of-the-art competitors by substantial margin.

We introduce generalized orders of magnitude (GOOMs), a principled extension of traditional orders of magnitude that incorporates floating-point numbers as a special case, and which in practice enables stable computation over significantly larger dynamic ranges of real numbers than previously possible. We implement GOOMs, along with an efficient custom parallel prefix scan, to support native execution on parallel hardware such as GPUs. We demonstrate that our implementation of GOOMs outperforms traditional approaches with three representative experiments, all of which were previously considered impractical or impossible, and now become possible and practical: (1) compounding real matrix products far beyond standard floating-point limits; (2) estimating spectra of Lyapunov exponents in parallel, orders of magnitude faster than with previous methods, applying a novel selective-resetting method to prevent state colinearity; and (3) capturing long-range dependencies in deep recurrent neural networks with non-diagonal recurrent states, computed in parallel via a prefix scan, without requiring any form of stabilization. Our results show that our implementation of GOOMs, combined with efficient parallel scanning, offers a scalable and numerically robust alternative to conventional floating-point numbers for high-dynamic-range applications.<br>

Alternative methods, such as zeroth-order optimization (ZO), can greatly reduce the memory footprint but come at the cost of significantly slower model convergence (10$\times$ to 100$\times$ more steps than backpropagation). We propose a memory-efficient implementation of backpropagation (MeBP) on mobile devices that provides better trade-off between memory usage and compute time, while converging faster and achieving better performance than the ZO baseline. We verify the effectiveness of MeBP on an iPhone 15 Pro Max and show that various LLMs, ranging from 0.5B to 4B parameters, can be fine-tuned using less than 1GB of memory.

While conceptually simple, evaluating the permanent is extremely challenging: no polynomial-time algorithm is available (unless $\textsc{P} = \textsc{NP}$). To the best of our knowledge there is no publicly available software that automatically uses the most efficient algorithm for computing the permanent. In this work we designed, developed, and investigated the performance of our software package which evaluates the permanent of an arbitrary rectangular matrix, supporting three algorithms generally regarded as the fastest while giving the exact solution (the straightforward combinatoric algorithm, the Ryser algorithm, and the Glynn algorithm) and, optionally, automatically switching to the optimal algorithm based on the type and dimensionality of the input matrix. To do this, we developed an extension of the Glynn algorithm to rectangular matrices.

Existing approaches often explore the adversarial space poorly, rely on hand-crafted heuristics, or lack systematic query refinement. We present NEXUS (Network Exploration for eXploiting Unsafe Sequences), a modular framework for constructing, refining, and executing optimized multi-turn attacks. NEXUS comprises: (1) ThoughtNet, which hierarchically expands a harmful intent into a structured semantic network of topics, entities, and query chains; (2) a feedback-driven Simulator that iteratively refines and prunes these chains through attacker-victim-judge LLM collaboration using harmfulness and semantic-similarity benchmarks; and (3) a Network Traverser that adaptively navigates the refined query space for real-time attacks. This pipeline uncovers stealthy, high-success adversarial paths across LLMs. On several closed-source and open-source LLMs, NEXUS increases attack success rate by 2.1% to 19.4% over prior methods.

If so, it will enable rapid prototyping of new programming languages and language features. We study this question using the imperative language IMP (a subset of C), formalized via small-step operational semantics (SOS) and rewriting-based operational semantics (K-semantics). We introduce three evaluation sets-Human-Written, LLM-Translated, and Fuzzer- Generated-whose difficulty is controlled by code-complexity metrics spanning the size, control-flow, and data-flow axes. Given a program and its semantics formalized with SOS/K-semantics, models are evaluated on three tasks ranging from coarse to fine: (1) final-state prediction, (2) semantic rule prediction, and (3) execution trace prediction. To distinguish pretraining memorization from semantic competence, we define two nonstandard semantics obtained through systematic mutations of the standard rules. Across strong code/reasoning LLMs, performance drops under nonstandard semantics despite high performance under the standard one. We further find that (i) there are patterns to different model failures, (ii) most reasoning models perform exceptionally well on coarse grained tasks involving reasoning about highly complex programs often containing nested loop depths beyond five, and surprisingly, (iii) providing formal semantics helps on simple programs but often hurts on more complex ones. Overall, the results show a promise that LLMs could serve as programming language interpreters, but points to the lack of their robust semantics understanding. We release the benchmark and the supporting code at https://github.com/EngineeringSoftware/PLSemanticsBench.<br>

Motivated by contradictory interpretations of whether models possess self-recognition (Panickssery et al., 2024; Davidson et al., 2024), we introduce a systematic evaluation framework that can be easily applied and updated. Specifically, we measure how well 10 contemporary larger language models (LLMs) can identify their own generated text versus text from other models through two tasks: binary self-recognition and exact model prediction. Different from prior claims, our results reveal a consistent failure in self-recognition. Only 4 out of 10 models predict themselves as generators, and the performance is rarely above random chance. Additionally, models exhibit a strong bias toward predicting GPT and Claude families. We also provide the first evaluation of model awareness of their own and others' existence, as well as the reasoning behind their choices in self-recognition. We find that the model demonstrates some knowledge of its own existence and other models, but their reasoning reveals a hierarchical bias. They appear to assume that GPT, Claude, and occasionally Gemini are the top-tier models, often associating high-quality text with them. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings on AI safety and future directions to develop appropriate AI self-awareness.<br>

Currently, the majority of existing methods utilize a generator to synthesize images to support the distillation. Although the current methods have achieved great success, there are still many issues to be explored. Firstly, the outstanding performance of supervised learning in deep learning drives us to explore a pseudo-supervised paradigm on DFKD. Secondly, current synthesized methods cannot distinguish the distributions of different categories of samples, thus producing ambiguous samples that may lead to an incorrect evaluation by the teacher. Besides, current methods cannot optimize the category-wise diversity samples, which will hinder the student model learning from diverse samples and further achieving better performance. In this paper, to address the above limitations, we propose a novel learning paradigm, i.e., conditional pseudo-supervised contrast for data-free knowledge distillation~(CPSC-DFKD). The primary innovations of CPSC-DFKD are: (1) introducing a conditional generative adversarial network to synthesize category-specific diverse images for pseudo-supervised learning, (2) improving the modules of the generator to distinguish the distributions of different categories, and (3) proposing pseudo-supervised contrastive learning based on teacher and student views to enhance diversity. Comprehensive experiments on three commonly-used datasets validate the performance lift of both the student and generator brought by CPSC-DFKD.

Existing methods, whether reconstruction-based (restoring normal counterparts) or embedding-based (pretrained representations), fundamentally conduct image- or feature-level matching to generate anomaly maps. Nonetheless, matching noise has been largely overlooked, limiting their detection ability. Beyond earlier focus on unimodal RGB-based UAD, recent advances expand to multimodal scenarios, e.g., RGB-3D and RGB-Text, enabled by point cloud sensing and vision-language models. Despite shared challenges, these lines remain largely isolated, hindering a comprehensive understanding and knowledge transfer. In this paper, we advocate unified UAD for both unimodal and multimodal settings in the matching perspective. Under this insight, we present Unified Cost Filtering (UCF), a generic post-hoc refinement framework for refining anomaly cost volume of any UAD model. The cost volume is constructed by matching a test sample against normal samples from the same or different modalities, followed by a learnable filtering module with multi-layer attention guidance from the test sample, mitigating matching noise and highlighting subtle anomalies. Comprehensive experiments on 22 diverse benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of UCF in enhancing a variety of UAD methods, consistently achieving new state-of-the-art results in both unimodal (RGB) and multimodal (RGB-3D, RGB-Text) UAD scenarios.

However, existing approaches typically overlook side information that could significantly improve reconstruction quality, especially in severely ill-posed settings. In this work, we propose a novel inference-time search algorithm that guides the sampling process using the side information in a manner that balances exploration and exploitation. This enables more accurate and reliable reconstructions, providing an alternative to the gradient-based guidance that is prone to reward-hacking artifacts. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of existing diffusion-based image reconstruction pipelines. Through extensive experiments on a number of inverse problems, such as box inpainting, super-resolution, and various deblurring tasks including motion, Gaussian, nonlinear, and blind deblurring, we show that our approach consistently improves the qualitative and quantitative performance of diffusion-based image reconstruction algorithms. We also show the superior performance of our approach with respect to other baselines, including reward gradient-based guidance algorithms.

On the balanced split, both models are strong; EfficientNet-B0 reaches 99% while ViT-Base remains competitive, indicating that balancing narrows architecture gaps while CNNs retain an efficiency edge. We release manifests, logs, and per-image predictions to support reproducibility.<br>

Pruning offers a promising path by inducing sparsity while preserving architectural flexibility. However, existing methods struggle to balance efficiency and robustness: local metric approaches prune layer by layer but often collapse under high sparsity, whereas global feedback methods enforce consistency at the cost of expensive weight updates or restrictive semi-structured formats. We present UniPruning, a unified post-training pruning framework that combines the speed of local saliency metrics with the stability of global coordination, enabled by a mirror descent based optimization, all without updating model weights. UniPruning leverages fast layer-wise scoring and a lightweight global controller to allocate a single sparsity budget, supporting both unstructured and semi-structured N :M pruning within one framework. After a brief calibration, it can generate pruning masks for arbitrary sparsity levels in one shot, and adapts seamlessly to hardware-aware constraints. Extensive experiments on multiple pretrained LLM families and standard benchmarks show that UniPruning consistently delivers competitive or superior perplexity and zero-shot accuracy. Ablation studies further highlight the importance of mirror descent and local saliency anchoring. Overall, UniPruning provides an efficient, principled, and scalable solution for sparsifying large-scale LLMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/RainbowQTT/UniPruning.<br>

In this work, we introduce SDQ-LLM: Sigma-Delta Quantization for 1-bit LLMs of any size, a novel framework that enables extremely low-bit quantization of LLMs while preserving their linguistic reasoning capabilities. A distinctive feature of SDQ-LLM is the continuous adjustability of the Over-Sampling Ratio (OSR), enabling dynamic adaptation to memory or VRAM constraints by selecting fractional OSR (e.g. 2.5 times) for an optimal trade-off between model size and accuracy. SDQ-LLM uses upsampling combined with Sigma-Delta Quantizer to binarize or ternarize LLMs weights, encoding high-precision parameters into 1-bit or 1.58-bit representations, replacing the multiplication operations within linear layers with addition. This approach significantly enhances inference efficiency under extremely low-bit quantization. To further reduce the loss of quantization precision, we incorporate Hadamard-based weight smoothing prior to quantization, improving the stability and robustness of the weight representations. Furthermore, to fully leverage the continuity of the OSR and reduce precision loss, recognizing the correlation between quantization sensitivity and weight variance, we propose a fine-grained, layer- and linear-wise OSR allocation strategy, MultiOSR. This strategy distributes OSR both across layers and within each layer, based on weight variance and parameter scale. Finally, extensive experiments on OPT and LLaMA model families demonstrate that SDQ-LLM achieves a more efficient and high-precision performance even under highly aggressive low-OSR settings.

Although post-training quantization (PTQ) is effective for AR LLMs, directly transferring it to dLLMs at 2-bit leads to unsatisfactory performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose Quant-dLLM, an ultra-low-bit PTQ framework tailored to dLLMs. Since masked-denoising activations in dLLMs differ from the fully visible signals assumed by standard PTQ methods, we introduce Masked Calibration Simulation (MCS) to align calibration with the timestep-dependent masking, which yields more reliable calibrations. Moreover, we propose a Data-aware Any-order Quantizer (DAQ) that learns ultra-low-bit weight representations via an optimization algorithm. It performs iterative approximation guided by our simulated calibration data. In addition, under a strict 2-bit budget, we introduce Adaptive Blockwise Mixed Precision (ABMP), a sensitivity-based precision allocation scheme that adaptively assigns bit width across channel groups. When restricted to 2-bit precision, Quant-dLLM consistently achieves higher accuracy than state-of-the-art (SOTA) AR-transfer PTQ methods on dLLMs. The code and models will be available at: https://github.com/ZTA2785/Quant-dLLM.<br>

To address these limitations, we introduce Synergistic Information Distillation (SID), a novel training framework that reframes deep learning as a cascade of local cooperative refinement problems. In SID, a deep network is structured as a pipeline of modules, each imposed with a local objective to refine a probabilistic belief about the ground-truth target. This objective balances fidelity to the target with consistency to the belief from its preceding module. By decoupling the backward dependencies between modules, SID enables parallel training and hence eliminates update locking and drastically reduces memory requirements. Meanwhile, this design preserves the standard feed-forward inference pass, making SID a versatile drop-in replacement for BP. We provide a theoretical foundation, proving that SID guarantees monotonic performance improvement with network depth. Empirically, SID consistently matches or surpasses the classification accuracy of BP, exhibiting superior scalability and pronounced robustness to label noise.Code is available at: https://github.com/ychAlbert/sid-bp<br>

While analyzing the decision boundary of large language models (LLMs) has raised increasing attention recently, constructing it for mainstream LLMs remains computationally infeasible due to the enormous vocabulary-sequence sizes and the auto-regressive nature of LLMs. To address this issue, in this paper we propose Decision Potential Surface (DPS), a new notion for analyzing LLM decision boundary. DPS is defined on the confidences in distinguishing different sampling sequences for each input, which naturally captures the potential of decision boundary. We prove that the zero-height isohypse in DPS is equivalent to the decision boundary of an LLM, with enclosed regions representing decision regions. By leveraging DPS, for the first time in the literature, we propose an approximate decision boundary construction algorithm, namely $K$-DPS, which only requires K-finite times of sequence sampling to approximate an LLM's decision boundary with negligible error. We theoretically derive the upper bounds for the absolute error, expected error, and the error concentration between K-DPS and the ideal DPS, demonstrating that such errors can be trade-off with sampling times. Our results are empirically validated by extensive experiments across various LLMs and corpora.<br>

Ternarization has gained attention as a promising compression technique, delivering substantial size reduction and high computational efficiency. However, its potential in the post-training quantization (PTQ) setting remains underexplored, due to the challenge of training-free parameter optimization and the quantization difficulty posed by outliers and dispersed weights. To address these issues, we propose PT$^2$-LLM, a post-training ternarization framework tailored for LLMs. At its core is an Asymmetric Ternary Quantizer equipped with a two-stage refinement pipeline: (1) Iterative Ternary Fitting (ITF), which alternates between optimal ternary grid construction and flexible rounding to minimize quantization error, and (2) Activation-aware Grid Alignment (AGA), which further refines the ternary grid to better match full-precision outputs. In addition, we propose a plug-and-play Structural Similarity-based Reordering (SSR) strategy that leverages inter-column structural similarity to ease quantization and mitigate outlier effects, further enhancing overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PT$^2$-LLM delivers competitive performance against state-of-the-art (SOTA) 2-bit PTQ methods with lower memory cost, while also accelerating both prefill and decoding to achieve end-to-end speedup.

Many existing TTA methods rely on entropy as a confidence metric to optimize the model. However, these approaches are sensitive to the predefined entropy threshold, influencing which samples are chosen for model adaptation. Consequently, potentially reliable target samples are often overlooked and underutilized. For instance, a sample's entropy might slightly exceed the threshold initially, but fall below it after the model is updated. Such samples can provide stable supervised information and offer a normal range of gradients to guide model adaptation. In this paper, we propose a general approach, \underline{POEM}, to promote TTA via ex\underline{\textbf{p}}loring the previously unexpl\underline{\textbf{o}}red reliabl\underline{\textbf{e}} sa\underline{\textbf{m}}ples. Additionally, we introduce an extra Adapt Branch network to strike a balance between extracting domain-agnostic representations and achieving high performance on target data. Comprehensive experiments across multiple architectures demonstrate that POEM consistently outperforms existing TTA methods in both challenging scenarios and real-world domain shifts, while remaining computationally efficient. The effectiveness of POEM is evaluated through extensive analyses and thorough ablation studies. Moreover, the core idea behind POEM can be employed as an augmentation strategy to boost the performance of existing TTA approaches.

Due to the extensive observation space arising from the large number of drivers and orders, order dispatching, though fundamentally a centralized task, is often addressed using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, independent MARL methods fail to capture global information and exhibit poor cooperation among workers, while Centralized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE) MARL methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To overcome these challenges, we propose Triple-BERT, a centralized Single Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) method designed specifically for large-scale order dispatching on ride-sharing platforms. Built on a variant TD3, our approach addresses the vast action space through an action decomposition strategy that breaks down the joint action probability into individual driver action probabilities. To handle the extensive observation space, we introduce a novel BERT-based network, where parameter reuse mitigates parameter growth as the number of drivers and orders increases, and the attention mechanism effectively captures the complex relationships among the large pool of driver and orders. We validate our method using a real-world ride-hailing dataset from Manhattan. Triple-BERT achieves approximately an 11.95% improvement over current state-of-the-art methods, with a 4.26% increase in served orders and a 22.25% reduction in pickup times.

Previous methods typically address this by maintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern meaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that an unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and destabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within RLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable low-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \textbf{\textit{reasoning sparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are systematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a degeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability Regularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a heuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out presumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining candidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of \textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft regularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL divergence. Experiments show that Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy training for around 1,000 steps, a regime where baseline entropy-control methods collapse. This sustained exploration leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a $60.17\%$ average accuracy on five math benchmarks, an improvement of $2.66\%$ over prior methods.

In existing designs, LLMs communicate through text, forcing internal representations to be transformed into output token sequences. This process both loses rich semantic information and incurs token-by-token generation latency. Motivated by these limitations, we ask: Can LLMs communicate beyond text? Oracle experiments show that enriching the KV-Cache semantics can improve response quality without increasing cache size, supporting KV-Cache as an effective medium for inter-model communication. Thus, we propose Cache-to-Cache (C2C), a new paradigm for direct semantic communication between LLMs. C2C uses a neural network to project and fuse the source model's KV-cache with that of the target model to enable direct semantic transfer. A learnable gating mechanism selects the target layers that benefit from cache communication. Compared with text communication, C2C utilizes the deep, specialized semantics from both models, while avoiding explicit intermediate text generation. Experiments show that C2C achieves 8.5-10.5% higher average accuracy than individual models. It further outperforms the text communication paradigm by approximately 3.0-5.0%, while delivering an average 2.0x speedup in latency. Our code is available at https://github.com/thu-nics/C2C.<br>

However, deriving these certificates for complex, unknown systems has traditionally required explicit knowledge of system dynamics, often making it a daunting task. This work introduces a novel framework that learns a Lyapunov function directly from trajectory data, enabling the certification of stability for autonomous systems without needing detailed system models. By parameterizing the Lyapunov candidate using a neural network and ensuring positive definiteness through Cholesky factorization, our approach automatically identifies whether the system is stable under the given trajectory. To address the challenges posed by noisy, real-world data, we allow for controlled violations of the stability condition, focusing on maintaining high confidence in the stability certification process. Our results demonstrate that this framework can provide data-driven stability guarantees, offering a robust method for certifying the safety of robotic systems in dynamic, real-world environments. This approach works without access to the internal control algorithms, making it applicable even in situations where system behavior is opaque or proprietary. The tool for learning the stability proof is open-sourced by this research: https://github.com/HansOersted/stability.<br>

While recent approaches, such as general DeepResearch agents and survey-specialized methods, can generate surveys automatically (a.k.a.

To fill the gap, we propose a fine-grained, quiz-driven evaluation framework SurveyBench, featuring (1) typical survey topics source from recent 11,343 arXiv papers and corresponding 4,947 high-quality surveys; (2) a multifaceted metric hierarchy that assesses the outline quality (e.g., coverage breadth, logical coherence), content quality (e.g., synthesis granularity, clarity of insights), and non-textual richness; and (3) a dual-mode evaluation protocol that includes content-based and quiz-based answerability tests, explicitly aligned with readers' informational needs.

As part of the standard reporting workflow, a junior radiologist typically prepares a preliminary report, which is then reviewed and edited by a senior radiologist to produce the final report. Identifying semantic differences between preliminary and final reports is essential for junior doctors, both as a training tool and to help uncover gaps in clinical knowledge. While AI in radiology is a rapidly growing field, the application of large language models (LLMs) remains challenging due to the need for specialised domain knowledge. In this paper, we explore the ability of LLMs to provide explainable and accurate comparisons of reports in the radiology domain. We begin by comparing the performance of several LLMs in comparing radiology reports. We then assess a more traditional approach based on Named-Entity-Recognition (NER). However, both approaches exhibit limitations in delivering accurate feedback on semantic similarity. To address this, we propose Llama-EntScore, a semantic similarity scoring method using a combination of Llama 3.1 and NER with tunable weights to emphasise or de-emphasise specific types of differences. Our approach generates a quantitative similarity score for tracking progress and also gives an interpretation of the score that aims to offer valuable guidance in reviewing and refining their reporting. We find our method achieves 67% exact-match accuracy and 93% accuracy within +/- 1 when compared to radiologist-provided ground truth scores - outperforming both LLMs and NER used independently.

While Bayesian optimization (BO) is the current state-of-the-art, its performance hinges on surrogate and acquisition function hyper-parameters that are often hand-tuned and fail to generalize across problem landscapes. We present ZeroShotOpt, a general-purpose, pretrained model for continuous black-box optimization tasks ranging from 2D to 20D. Our approach leverages offline reinforcement learning on large-scale optimization trajectories collected from 12 BO variants. To scale pretraining, we generate millions of synthetic Gaussian process-based functions with diverse landscapes, enabling the model to learn transferable optimization policies. As a result, ZeroShotOpt achieves robust zero-shot generalization on a wide array of unseen benchmarks, matching or surpassing the sample efficiency of leading global optimizers, including BO, while also offering a reusable foundation for future extensions and improvements.

Accurate predictions are important for applications including motion planning, tracking, human-robot interaction, and safety monitoring. In this paper, we exploit Maps of Dynamics (MoDs), which encode spatial or spatio-temporal motion patterns as environment features, to achieve LHMP for horizons of up to 60 seconds. We propose an MoD-informed LHMP framework that supports various types of MoDs and includes a ranking method to output the most likely predicted trajectory, improving practical utility in robotics. Further, a time-conditioned MoD is introduced to capture motion patterns that vary across different times of day. We evaluate MoD-LHMP instantiated with three types of MoDs. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that MoD-informed method outperforms learning-based ones, with up to 50\% improvement in average displacement error, and the time-conditioned variant achieves the highest accuracy overall.

Recently, machine learning classifiers based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have been developed to identify brain biomarkers that differentiate psychiatric disorders from healthy controls. However, conventional machine learning-based diagnostic models often depend on extensive feature engineering, which introduces bias through manual intervention. While deep learning models are expected to operate without manual involvement, their lack of interpretability poses significant challenges in obtaining explainable and reliable brain biomarkers to support diagnostic decisions, ultimately limiting their clinical applicability. In this study, we introduce an end-to-end innovative graph neural network framework named BrainIB++, which applies the information bottleneck (IB) principle to identify the most informative data-driven brain regions as subgraphs during model training for interpretation. We evaluate the performance of our model against nine established brain network classification methods across three multi-cohort schizophrenia datasets. It consistently demonstrates superior diagnostic accuracy and exhibits generalizability to unseen data. Furthermore, the subgraphs identified by our model also correspond with established clinical biomarkers in schizophrenia, particularly emphasizing abnormalities in the visual, sensorimotor, and higher cognition brain functional network. This alignment enhances the model's interpretability and underscores its relevance for real-world diagnostic applications.<br>

Our method encodes input and target images into two latent distributions that are symmetric concerning a standard normal distribution, effectively separating shared and independent features. The Y-shaped bidirectional training strategy further enhances the interpretability of feature separation.

These datasets often contain proprietary or copyrighted material, raising the need for reliable safeguards against unauthorized use. Existing membership inference attacks (MIAs) and dataset-inference methods typically require access to internal signals such as logits, while current black-box approaches often rely on handcrafted prompts or a clean reference dataset for calibration, both of which limit practical applicability. Watermarking is a promising alternative, but prior techniques can degrade text quality or reduce task performance. We propose TRACE, a practical framework for fully black-box detection of copyrighted dataset usage in LLM fine-tuning. \texttt{TRACE} rewrites datasets with distortion-free watermarks guided by a private key, ensuring both text quality and downstream utility. At detection time, we exploit the radioactivity effect of fine-tuning on watermarked data and introduce an entropy-gated procedure that selectively scores high-uncertainty tokens, substantially amplifying detection power. Across diverse datasets and model families, TRACE consistently achieves significant detections (p<0.05), often with extremely strong statistical evidence. Furthermore, it supports multi-dataset attribution and remains robust even after continued pretraining on large non-watermarked corpora. These results establish TRACE as a practical route to reliable black-box verification of copyrighted dataset usage. We will make our code available at: https://github.com/NusIoraPrivacy/TRACE.<br>

While decreasing the time it takes for a transaction to be included in the blockchain ledger enhances user experience, a fundamental delay still remains between when a transaction is issued by a user and when its inclusion is confirmed in the blockchain ledger. This delay limits user experience gains through the confirmation uncertainty it brings for users. This inherent delay in conventional blockchain protocols has led to the emergence of preconfirmation protocols -- protocols that provide users with early guarantees of eventual transaction confirmation. This article presents a Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) on preconfirmations. We present the core terms and definitions needed to understand preconfirmations, outline a general framework for preconfirmation protocols, and explore the economics and risks of preconfirmations.

This paper introduces ELMF4EggQ, an ensemble learning framework that employs multimodal feature fusion to classify egg grade and freshness using only external attributes - image, shape, and weight. A novel, publicly available dataset of 186 brown-shelled eggs was constructed, with egg grade and freshness levels determined through laboratory-based expert assessments involving internal quality measurements, such as yolk index and Haugh unit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply machine learning methods for internal egg quality assessment using only external, non-invasive features, and the first to release a corresponding labeled dataset. The proposed framework integrates deep features extracted from external egg images with structural characteristics such as egg shape and weight, enabling a comprehensive representation of each egg. Image feature extraction is performed using top-performing pre-trained CNN models (ResNet152, DenseNet169, and ResNet152V2), followed by PCA-based dimensionality reduction, SMOTE augmentation, and classification using multiple machine learning algorithms. An ensemble voting mechanism combines predictions from the best-performing classifiers to enhance overall accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the multimodal approach significantly outperforms image-only and tabular (shape and weight) only baselines, with the multimodal ensemble approach achieving 86.57% accuracy in grade classification and 70.83% in freshness prediction. All code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/Kenshin-Keeps/Egg_Quality_Prediction_ELMF4EggQ, promoting transparency, reproducibility, and further research in this domain.<br>

While existing solvers rely on information-theoretic entropy maximization or frequency-based heuristics without formal constraint treatment, we present the first comprehensive CSP formulation of Wordle with novel constraint-aware solving strategies. We introduce CSP-Aware Entropy, computing information gain after constraint propagation rather than on raw candidate sets, and a Probabilistic CSP framework integrating Bayesian word-frequency priors with logical constraints. Through evaluation on 2,315 English words, CSP-Aware Entropy achieves 3.54 average guesses with 99.9% success rate, a statistically significant 1.7% improvement over Forward Checking (t=-4.82, p<0.001, Cohen's d=0.07) with 46% faster runtime (12.9ms versus 23.7ms per guess). Under 10% noise, CSP-aware approaches maintain 5.3 percentage point advantages (29.0% versus 23.7%, p=0.041), while Probabilistic CSP achieves 100% success across all noise levels (0-20%) through constraint recovery mechanisms. Cross-lexicon validation on 500 Spanish words demonstrates 88% success with zero language-specific tuning, validating that core CSP principles transfer across languages despite an 11.2 percentage point gap from linguistic differences (p<0.001, Fisher's exact test). Our open-source implementation with 34 unit tests achieving 91% code coverage provides reproducible infrastructure for CSP research. The combination of formal CSP treatment, constraint-aware heuristics, probabilistic-logical integration, robustness analysis, and cross-lexicon validation establishes new performance benchmarks demonstrating that principled constraint satisfaction techniques outperform classical information-theoretic and learning-based approaches for structured puzzle-solving domains.<br>

To bridge this gap, we present C2|Q>: a hardware-agnostic quantum software development framework that translates classical specifications (code) into quantum-executable programs while preserving methodological rigor. The framework applies modular software engineering principles by classifying the workflow into three core modules: an encoder that classifies problems, produces Quantum-Compatible Formats (QCFs), and constructs quantum circuits, a deployment module that generates circuits and recommends hardware based on fidelity, runtime, and cost, and a decoder that interprets quantum outputs into classical solutions. In evaluation, the encoder module achieved a 93.8% completion rate, the hardware recommendation module consistently selected the appropriate quantum devices for workloads scaling up to 56 qubits, and the full C2|Q>: workflow successfully processed classical specifications (434 Python snippets and 100 JSON inputs) with completion rates of 93.8% and 100%, respectively. For case study problems executed on publicly available NISQ hardware, C2|Q>: reduced the required implementation effort by nearly 40X compared to manual implementations using low-level quantum software development kits (SDKs), with empirical runs limited to small- and medium-sized instances consistent with current NISQ capabilities.

Among these attacks, finetuning-based ones that compromise LLMs' safety alignment via fine-tuning stand out due to its stable jailbreak performance. In particular, a recent study indicates that fine-tuning with as few as 10 harmful question-answer (QA) pairs can lead to successful jailbreaking across various harmful questions. However, such malicious fine-tuning attacks are readily detectable and hence thwarted by moderation models. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs can be jailbroken by fine-tuning with only 10 benign QA pairs; our attack exploits the increased sensitivity of LLMs to fine-tuning data after being overfitted. Specifically, our fine-tuning process starts with overfitting an LLM via fine-tuning with benign QA pairs involving identical refusal answers. Further fine-tuning is then performed with standard benign answers, causing the overfitted LLM to forget the refusal attitude and thus provide compliant answers regardless of the harmfulness of a question. We implement our attack on the ten LLMs and compare it with five existing baselines. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant advantages in both attack effectiveness and attack stealth. Our findings expose previously unreported security vulnerabilities in current LLMs and provide a new perspective on understanding how LLMs' security is compromised, even with benign fine-tuning.

While their capabilities are improving, problems emerge simultaneously. Among those problems, the hallucinations have attracted much attention, which stands for the phenomenon where LVLMs generate contradictory content to their input visual and text contents. Many approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue, such as contrastive decoding and attention manipulation. However, contrastive decoding methods struggle in constructing appropriate contrastive samples, and attention manipulation methods are highly sensitive, lacking stability. In this work, we propose image head Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD). Our approach utilizes the "image heads" in LVLMs, masking them to construct contrastive samples for contrastive decoding. We evaluated MaskCD on LLaVA-1.5-7b and Qwen-VL-7b, using various benchmarks such as CHAIR, POPE, AMBER and MME. The results demonstrate that MaskCD effectively alleviates the phenomenon of hallucinations and retains the general capabilities of LVLMs. Corresponding resources could be found at: https://github.com/Deng-Jingyuan/MaskCD .<br>

Most current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely on uniform sampling, which often overlooks critical moments, leading to incorrect responses to queries. In parallel, many keyframe selection approaches impose rigid temporal spacing: once a frame is chosen, an exclusion window suppresses adjacent timestamps to reduce redundancy. While effective at limiting overlap, this strategy frequently misses short, fine-grained cues near important events. Other methods instead emphasize visual diversity but neglect query relevance. We propose AdaRD-Key, a training-free keyframe sampling module for query-driven long-form video understanding. AdaRD-Key maximizes a unified Relevance--Diversity Max-Volume (RD-MV) objective, combining a query-conditioned relevance score with a log-determinant diversity component to yield informative yet non-redundant frames. To handle broad queries with weak alignment to the video, AdaRD-Key employs a lightweight relevance-aware gating mechanism; when the relevance distribution indicates weak alignment, the method seamlessly shifts into a diversity-only mode, enhancing coverage without additional supervision. Our pipeline is training-free, computationally efficient (running in real time on a single GPU), and compatible with existing VLMs in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments on LongVideoBench and Video-MME demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly on long-form videos. Code available at https://github.com/Xian867/AdaRD-Key.<br>

We study model abliteration, a lightweight projection technique designed to remove refusal-sensitive directions, and conduct a controlled evaluation across a granular sequence of Safety Pretraining checkpoints for SmolLM2-1.7B, alongside widely used open baselines. For each of 20 systems, original and abliterated, we issue 100 prompts with balanced harmful and harmless cases, classify responses as **Refusal** or **Non-Refusal** using multiple judges, and validate judge fidelity on a small human-labeled subset. We also probe whether models can identify refusal in their own outputs. Our study produces a checkpoint-level characterization of which data-centric safety components remain robust under abliteration, quantifies how judge selection influences evaluation outcomes, and outlines a practical protocol for integrating inference-time edits into safety assessments.

The absence of visual grounding further restricts precision and personalization, as language alone cannot specify fine-grained spatiotemporal details. We propose MoGIC, a unified framework that integrates intention modeling and visual priors into multimodal motion synthesis. By jointly optimizing multimodal-conditioned motion generation and intention prediction, MoGIC uncovers latent human goals, leverages visual priors to enhance generation, and exhibits versatile multimodal generative capability. We further introduce a mixture-of-attention mechanism with adaptive scope to enable effective local alignment between conditional tokens and motion subsequences. To support this paradigm, we curate Mo440H, a 440-hour benchmark from 21 high-quality motion datasets. Experiments show that after finetuning, MoGIC reduces FID by 38.6\% on HumanML3D and 34.6\% on Mo440H, surpasses LLM-based methods in motion captioning with a lightweight text head, and further enables intention prediction and vision-conditioned generation, advancing controllable motion synthesis and intention understanding.

Instead, researchers design recipes that train well across scales based on their understanding of the hyperparameters. Despite this importance, few tools exist for understanding the hyperparameter loss surface. We discover novel structure in it and propose a new theory yielding such tools. The loss surface is complex, but as you approach the optimum simple structure emerges. It becomes characterized by a few basic features, like its effective dimension and the best possible loss. To uncover this asymptotic regime, we develop a novel technique based on random search. Within this regime, the best scores from random search take on a new distribution we discover. Its parameters are exactly the features defining the loss surface in the asymptotic regime. From these features, we derive a new asymptotic law for random search that can explain and extrapolate its convergence. These new tools enable new analyses, such as confidence intervals for the best possible performance or determining the effective number of hyperparameters.

Prior work on risk-averse offline RL achieves safety at the cost of value conservatism and restricted policy classes, whereas expressive policies are only used in risk-neutral settings. Here, we address this gap by introducing the \textbf{Risk-Aware Multimodal Actor-Critic (RAMAC)} framework, which couples an \emph{expressive generative actor} with a distributional critic. The RAMAC differentiates composite objective combining distributional risk and BC loss through the generative path, achieving risk-sensitive learning in complex multimodal scenarios.

While wired broadband ISPs are rolling out the leading queue occupancy signaling mechanisms, the cellular Radio Access Network (RAN), another important last mile to many users, lags behind these efforts. This paper proposes a new RAN design, L4Span, that abstracts the complexities of RAN queueing in a simple interface, thus tying the queue state of the RAN to end-to-end low-latency signaling all the way back to the content server. At millisecond-level timescales, L4Span predicts the RAN's queuing occupancy and performs ECN marking for both low-latency and classic flows. L4Span is lightweight, requiring minimal RAN modifications, and remains 3GPP and O-RAN compliant for maximum ease of deployment. We implement a prototype on the srsRAN open-source software in C++. Our evaluation compares the performance of low-latency as well as classic flows with or without the deployment of L4Span in various wireless channel conditions. Results show that L4Span reduces the one-way delay of both low-latency and classic flows by up to 98 %, while simultaneously maintaining near line-rate throughput.

The SoT method converts language-specific semantic information into language-agnostic structured representations, enabling the models to understand the query in different languages more sophisticated. Besides, SoT effectively guides LLMs toward more concentrated reasoning to maintain consistent underlying reasoning pathways when handling cross-lingual variations in expression. Experimental results demonstrate that SoT outperforms several strong baselines on multiple multilingual reasoning benchmarks when adapting to various backbones of LLMs. It can also be integrated with other training-free strategies for further improvements.

The IEM is rooted in a fundamental relationship between information theory and estimation theory, which links the log-probability of a signal with the errors of an optimal denoiser, applied to noisy observations of the signal. In particular, the IEM between a pair of signals is obtained by comparing their denoising error vectors over a range of noise amplitudes. Geometrically, this amounts to comparing the score vector fields of the blurred density around the signals over a range of blur levels. We prove that the IEM is a valid global metric and derive a closed-form expression for its local second-order approximation, which yields a Riemannian metric. For Gaussian-distributed signals, the IEM coincides with the Mahalanobis distance. But for more complex distributions, it adapts, both locally and globally, to the geometry of the distribution. In practice, the IEM can be computed using a learned denoiser (analogous to generative diffusion models) and solving a one-dimensional integral. To demonstrate the value of our framework, we learn an IEM on the ImageNet database. Experiments show that this IEM is competitive with or outperforms state-of-the-art supervised image quality metrics in predicting human perceptual judgments.<br>

However, the deployment model and usage of LLM services remain highly centralized, creating significant trust issues and costs for end users and developers. To address these issues, we propose PolyLink, a blockchain-based decentralized AI platform that decentralizes LLM development and inference. Specifically, PolyLink introduces a decentralized crowdsourcing architecture that supports single-device and cross-device model deployment and inference across heterogeneous devices at the edge. Moreover, to ensure the inference integrity, we design the TIQE protocol, which combines a lightweight cross-encoder model and an LLM-as-a-Judge for a high-accuracy inference evaluation. Lastly, we integrate a comprehensive token-based incentive model with dynamic pricing and reward mechanisms for all participants. We have deployed PolyLink and conducted an extensive real-world evaluation through geo-distributed deployment across heterogeneous devices. Results indicate that the inference and verification latency is practical. Our security analysis demonstrates that the system is resistant to model degradation attacks and validator corruptions.

However, LLM-generated code still suffers from compilation and runtime errors. Existing offline preference optimization methods primarily focus on enhancing LLMs' coding abilities using pass/fail signals in the preference data, overlooking the deep-level error types in the failed codes. To address this, we propose Adaptively Progressive Preference Optimization (AP2O) for coding (i.e., AP2O-Coder), a method that guides LLMs adaptively and methodically to reduce code errors for code generation. Specifically, we construct an error notebook from failed codes and progressively optimize the LLM to correct errors type by type. Furthermore, we adaptively replay error types to tailor to the LLM's changing weaknesses throughout the training process. Through extensive experiments on both code and general LLMs (Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek series) with parameters ranging from 0.5B to 34B, our AP2O-Coder improves code generation performance by up to 3% in pass@k while using less preference data.

However, the knowledge updating mechanism of LLMs remains largely unexplored due to insufficient, isolated, and small-scale evaluation. For instance, are LLMs similar to humans in modifying certain knowledge? What differs editing and unlearning as training data increases? This paper proposes KnowledgeSmith, a unified framework to systematically understand the updating mechanism of LLMs. We first cast editing and unlearning as instances of one constrained optimization problem. Then, we propose an automatic dataset generator that provides structured interventions across multiple graph levels and data scales, enabling controlled studies of how different modification strategies propagate through model knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate nuanced insights over knowledge propagation, plasticity scaling, consistency, and robustness. For instance, our results show that LLMs do not exhibit similar updating as humans for different levels of knowledge, and there exists consistency-capacity trade-off. We hope our findings can offer suggestions to the design of more reliable and scalable strategies. Code: https://github.com/AIFrontierLab/KnowledgeSmith.git<br>

To the best of my knowledge, our algorithm is the first one that samples a 1024 x 1024 resolution image in 8 steps with an FID performance comparable to that of the latest distillation model, but without additional training. Meanwhile, our algorithm can also generate a 512 x 512 image in 8 steps, and its FID performance is better than the inference result using state-of-the-art ODE solver DPM++ 2m in 20 steps. We validate our eight-step image generation algorithm using the COCO 2014, COCO 2017, and LAION datasets. And our best FID performance is 15.7, 22.35, and 17.52. While the FID performance of DPM++2m is 17.3, 23.75, and 17.33. Further, it also outperforms the state-of-the-art AMED-plugin solver, whose FID performance is 19.07, 25.50, and 18.06.

However, this reliance on memory introduces a critical security risk: an adversary can inject seemingly harmless records into an agent's memory to manipulate its future behavior. This vulnerability is characterized by two core aspects: First, the malicious effect of injected records is only activated within a specific context, making them hard to detect when individual memory entries are audited in isolation. Second, once triggered, the manipulation can initiate a self-reinforcing error cycle: the corrupted outcome is stored as precedent, which not only amplifies the initial error but also progressively lowers the threshold for similar attacks in the future. To address these challenges, we introduce A-MemGuard (Agent-Memory Guard), the first proactive defense framework for LLM agent memory. The core idea of our work is the insight that memory itself must become both self-checking and self-correcting. Without modifying the agent's core architecture, A-MemGuard combines two mechanisms: (1) consensus-based validation, which detects anomalies by comparing reasoning paths derived from multiple related memories and (2) a dual-memory structure, where detected failures are distilled into ``lessons'' stored separately and consulted before future actions, breaking error cycles and enabling adaptation. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks show that A-MemGuard effectively cuts attack success rates by over 95% while incurring a minimal utility cost. This work shifts LLM memory security from static filtering to a proactive, experience-driven model where defenses strengthen over time.

However, their limitations in detecting only known anomalies prompt the exploration of alternative approaches. Motivated by the success of self-supervised learning in computer vision, there is a rising interest in adapting this paradigm for network intrusion detection. While prior research mainly delved into contrastive self-supervised methods, the efficacy of non-contrastive methods, in conjunction with encoder architectures serving as the representation learning backbone and augmentation strategies that determine what is learned, remains unclear for effective attack detection. This paper compares the performance of five non-contrastive self-supervised learning methods using three encoder architectures and six augmentation strategies. Ninety experiments are systematically conducted on two network intrusion detection datasets, UNSW-NB15 and 5G-NIDD. For each self-supervised model, the combination of encoder architecture and augmentation method yielding the highest average precision, recall, F1-score, and AUCROC is reported. Furthermore, by comparing the best-performing models to two unsupervised baselines, DeepSVDD, and an Autoencoder, we showcase the competitiveness of the non-contrastive methods for attack detection.

Existing preference learning approaches are poorly aligned with this data profile, as they rely on costly human annotations or assume plentiful positive responses. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{DRIFT} (\textbf{D}issatisfaction-\textbf{R}efined \textbf{I}terative pre\textbf{F}erence \textbf{T}raining), which anchors training on real-world DSAT signals and samples positives dynamically from the evolving policy. Empirically, DRIFT models trained on real-world \textit{WildFeedback} datasets and synthetic \textit{UltraFeedback} datasets achieve up to +6.23\% (7B) / +7.61\% (14B) on WildBench Task Score and up to +8.95\% (7B) / +12.29\% (14B) on AlpacaEval2 win rate over base models, outperforming strong baseline methods such as iterative DPO and SPIN. At larger scales, the improvements are particularly pronounced: 14B models trained with DRIFT surpass GPT-4o-mini on WildBench. Further analysis shows that DRIFT also preserves exploratory capacity, yielding more diverse high-reward solutions rather than collapsing to narrow subsets. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this design preserves preference margins and avoids the gradient degeneration. These results show that DRIFT is an effective and scalable recipe for real-world post-training that leverages the most abundant and informative signal.

With the recent emergence of prompting-based unlearning techniques, a natural question arises: Can LLMs be prompted to simulate an earlier knowledge cutoff? In this work, we investigate the capability of prompting to simulate earlier knowledge cutoff in LLMs. We construct three evaluation datasets to assess the extent to which LLMs can forget (1) direct factual knowledge, (2) semantic shifts, and (3) causally related knowledge. Results demonstrate that while prompt-based simulated knowledge cutoffs show effectiveness when directly queried with the information after that date, they struggle to induce forgetting when the forgotten content is not directly asked but causally related to the query. These findings highlight the need for more rigorous evaluation settings when applying LLMs for temporal prediction tasks.

Diagnosing the root causes of these failures poses a critical challenge for AI safety. Existing attribution methods, particularly those based on parameter gradients, often fall short due to prohibitive noisy signals and computational complexity. In this work, we introduce a novel and efficient framework that diagnoses a range of undesirable LLM behaviors by analyzing representation and its gradients, which operates directly in the model's activation space to provide a semantically meaningful signal linking outputs to their training data. We systematically evaluate our method for tasks that include tracking harmful content, detecting backdoor poisoning, and identifying knowledge contamination. The results demonstrate that our approach not only excels at sample-level attribution but also enables fine-grained token-level analysis, precisely identifying the specific samples and phrases that causally influence model behavior.

We introduce the first theoretical framework with a principled, optimizable objective for steering sampling dynamics toward multi-subject fidelity. Viewing flow matching (FM) through stochastic optimal control (SOC), we formulate subject disentanglement as control over a trained FM sampler. This yields two architecture-agnostic algorithms: (i) a training-free test-time controller that perturbs the base velocity with a single-pass update, and (ii) Adjoint Matching, a lightweight fine-tuning rule that regresses a control network to a backward adjoint signal while preserving base-model capabilities. The same formulation unifies prior attention heuristics, extends to diffusion models via a flow-diffusion correspondence, and provides the first fine-tuning route explicitly designed for multi-subject fidelity. Empirically, on Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, and Stable Diffusion XL, both algorithms consistently improve multi-subject alignment while maintaining base-model style. Test-time control runs efficiently on commodity GPUs, and fine-tuned controllers trained on limited prompts generalize to unseen ones. We further highlight FOCUS (Flow Optimal Control for Unentangled Subjects), which achieves state-of-the-art multi-subject fidelity across models.<br>

To address this task, we introduce a model-agnostic framework that combines data-free input synthesis and statistical score computation for detecting distillation.

While CLIP exhibits strong zero-shot transfer, its reliance on coarse global features restricts its performance on fine-grained classification tasks. Prior efforts inject fine-grained knowledge by aligning large language model (LLM) descriptions with the CLIP $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token; however, this approach overlooks spatial precision. We propose $\textbf{microCLIP}$, a self-training framework that jointly refines CLIP's visual and textual representations using fine-grained cues. At its core is Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP) within a lightweight TokenFusion module, which builds a saliency-guided $\texttt{[FG]}$ token from patch embeddings and fuses it with the global $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token for coarse-fine alignment. To stabilize adaptation, we introduce a two-headed LLM-derived classifier: a frozen classifier that, via multi-view alignment, provides a stable text-based prior for pseudo-labeling, and a learnable classifier initialized from LLM descriptions and fine-tuned with TokenFusion. We further develop Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation, which convexly combines fixed LLM/CLIP priors with TokenFusion's evolving logits to iteratively refine pseudo-labels. Together, these components uncover latent fine-grained signals in CLIP, yielding a consistent $2.90\%$ average accuracy gain across 13 fine-grained benchmarks while requiring only light adaptation.

Current approaches address this gap by retargeting human motion data to humanoid embodiments and then training reinforcement learning (RL) policies to imitate these reference trajectories. However, artifacts introduced during retargeting, such as foot sliding, self-penetration, and physically infeasible motion are often left in the reference trajectories for the RL policy to correct. While prior work has demonstrated motion tracking abilities, they often require extensive reward engineering and domain randomization to succeed. In this paper, we systematically evaluate how retargeting quality affects policy performance when excessive reward tuning is suppressed. To address issues that we identify with existing retargeting methods, we propose a new retargeting method, General Motion Retargeting (GMR). We evaluate GMR alongside two open-source retargeters, PHC and ProtoMotions, as well as with a high-quality closed-source dataset from Unitree. Using BeyondMimic for policy training, we isolate retargeting effects without reward tuning. Our experiments on a diverse subset of the LAFAN1 dataset reveal that while most motions can be tracked, artifacts in retargeted data significantly reduce policy robustness, particularly for dynamic or long sequences. GMR consistently outperforms existing open-source methods in both tracking performance and faithfulness to the source motion, achieving perceptual fidelity and policy success rates close to the closed-source baseline.

This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by analyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain this failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to solve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct solutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the probability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we uncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces problems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while suppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical and empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show that this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL objectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies. Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation algorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving notable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance.

While Transformers have been the dominant architecture, recent alternatives such as xLSTM offer linear complexity with respect to context length while remaining competitive in the billion-parameter regime. We conduct a comparative investigation on the scaling behavior of Transformers and xLSTM along the following lines, providing insights to guide future model design and deployment. First, we study the scaling behavior for xLSTM in compute-optimal and over-training regimes using both IsoFLOP and parametric fit approaches on a wide range of model sizes (80M-7B) and number of training tokens (2B-2T). Second, we examine the dependence of optimal model sizes on context length, a pivotal aspect that was largely ignored in previous work. Finally, we analyze inference-time scaling characteristics. Our findings reveal that in typical LLM training and inference scenarios, xLSTM scales favorably compared to Transformers. Importantly, xLSTM's advantage widens as training and inference contexts grow.<br>

However, prevailing methods primarily rely on self-exploration or a single off-policy teacher to elicit long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) reasoning, which may introduce intrinsic model biases and restrict exploration, ultimately limiting reasoning diversity and performance. Drawing inspiration from multi-teacher strategies in knowledge distillation, we introduce Adaptive Multi-Guidance Policy Optimization (AMPO), a novel framework that adaptively leverages guidance from multiple proficient teacher models, but only when the on-policy model fails to generate correct solutions. This "guidance-on-demand" approach expands exploration while preserving the value of self-discovery. Moreover, AMPO incorporates a comprehension-based selection mechanism, prompting the student to learn from the reasoning paths that it is most likely to comprehend, thus balancing broad exploration with effective exploitation. Extensive experiments show AMPO substantially outperforms a strong baseline (GRPO), with a 4.3% improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks and 12.2% on out-of-distribution tasks, while significantly boosting Pass@k performance and enabling more diverse exploration. Notably, using four peer-sized teachers, our method achieves comparable results to approaches that leverage a single, more powerful teacher (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) with more data. These results demonstrate a more efficient and scalable path to superior reasoning and generalizability. Our code is available at https://github.com/SII-Enigma/AMPO.<br>

Directly projecting 2D features into 3D yields noisy and fragmented predictions, whereas enforcing geometric coherence necessitates costly training pipelines and large-scale annotated 3D data. We argue that this limitation stems from the dominant segmentation-and-matching paradigm, which fails to reconcile 2D semantics with 3D geometric structure. The geometric cues are not eliminated during the 2D-to-3D transfer but remain latent within the noisy and view-aggregated features. To exploit this property, we propose GeoPurify that applies a small Student Affinity Network to purify 2D VLM-generated 3D point features using geometric priors distilled from a 3D self-supervised teacher model. During inference, we devise a Geometry-Guided Pooling module to further denoise the point cloud and ensure the semantic and structural consistency. Benefiting from latent geometric information and the learned affinity network, GeoPurify effectively mitigates the trade-off and achieves superior data efficiency. Extensive experiments on major 3D benchmarks demonstrate that GeoPurify achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while utilizing only about 1.5% of the training data.

Existing medical imaging datasets are not designed to systematically study this issue, largely due to restrictive licensing and limited supplementary patient data. To address this gap, we introduce SpurBreast, a curated breast MRI dataset that intentionally incorporates spurious correlations to evaluate their impact on model performance. Analyzing over 100 features involving patient, device, and imaging protocol, we identify two dominant spurious signals: magnetic field strength (a global feature influencing the entire image) and image orientation (a local feature affecting spatial alignment). Through controlled dataset splits, we demonstrate that DNNs can exploit these non-clinical signals, achieving high validation accuracy while failing to generalize to unbiased test data. Alongside these two datasets containing spurious correlations, we also provide benchmark datasets without spurious correlations, allowing researchers to systematically investigate clinically relevant and irrelevant features, uncertainty estimation, adversarial robustness, and generalization strategies.

Furthermore, our designed point cloud localization module, guided by 2D part segmentation, enables partial point cloud localization in scenes, thereby extending grasping operations from coarse-grained object-level to fine-grained part-level manipulation. Experimental results show that the LangGrasp framework accurately resolves implicit intents in ambiguous instructions, identifying critical operations and target information that are unstated yet essential for task completion. Additionally, it dynamically selects optimal grasping poses by integrating environmental information.

Stochastic sampling via Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) is employed during the denoising process to generate diverse denoising directions for RL exploration. While existing methods effectively explore potential high-value samples, they suffer from sub-optimal preference alignment due to sparse and narrow reward signals. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Granular-GRPO ($\text{G}^2$RPO ) framework that achieves precise and comprehensive reward assessments of sampling directions in reinforcement learning of flow models. Specifically, a Singular Stochastic Sampling strategy is introduced to support step-wise stochastic exploration while enforcing a high correlation between the reward and the injected noise, thereby facilitating a faithful reward for each SDE perturbation. Concurrently, to eliminate the bias inherent in fixed-granularity denoising, we introduce a Multi-Granularity Advantage Integration module that aggregates advantages computed at multiple diffusion scales, producing a more comprehensive and robust evaluation of the sampling directions. Experiments conducted on various reward models, including both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations, demonstrate that our $\text{G}^2$RPO significantly outperforms existing flow-based GRPO baselines,highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.<br>

This paper introduces ktbox, a modular LaTeX framework that unifies semantic color palettes, structured highlight boxes, taxonomy trees, and author metadata utilities into a coherent system for scholarly writing. The framework is distributed as a set of lightweight, namespaced components: ktcolor.sty for semantic palettes, ktbox.sty for structured highlight and takeaway environments, ktlrtree.sty for taxonomy trees with fusion and auxiliary annotations, and ktorcid.sty for ORCID-linked author metadata. Each component is independently usable yet interoperable, ensuring compatibility with major templates such as IEEEtran, acmart, iclr conference, and beamer. Key features include auto-numbered takeaway boxes, wide-format highlights, flexible taxonomy tree visualizations, and multi-column layouts supporting embedded tables, enumerations, and code blocks. By adopting a clear separation of concerns and enforcing a consistent naming convention under the kt namespace, the framework transforms visual styling from cosmetic add-ons into reproducible, extensible building blocks of scientific communication, improving clarity, portability, and authoring efficiency across articles, posters, and presentations.<br>

However, existing approaches for vision tasks often rely on indirect representations, such as generating coordinates as text for detection, which limits performance and prevents dense prediction tasks like segmentation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT), a unified paradigm that enables MLLMs to directly generate both textual and diverse visual outputs. Central to PaDT are Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs), derived from visual patch embeddings of query images and interleaved seamlessly with LLM's output textual tokens. A lightweight decoder then transforms LLM's outputs into detection, segmentation, and grounding predictions. Unlike prior methods, PaDT processes VRTs independently at each forward pass and dynamically expands the embedding table, thus improving localization and differentiation among similar objects. We further tailor a training strategy for PaDT by randomly selecting VRTs for supervised fine-tuning and introducing a robust per-token cross-entropy loss. Our empirical studies across four visual perception and understanding tasks suggest PaDT consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance, even compared with significantly larger MLLM models.

However, it still lags behind full fine-tuning in performance, partly due to its insufficient exploitation of the geometric structure underlying low-rank manifolds. In this paper, we propose a geometry-aware extension of LoRA that uses a three-factor decomposition $U\!SV^\top$. Analogous to the structure of singular value decomposition (SVD), it separates the adapter's input and output subspaces, $V$ and $U$, from the scaling factor $S$. Our method constrains $U$ and $V$ to lie on the Stiefel manifold, ensuring their orthonormality throughout the training. To optimize on the Stiefel manifold, we employ a flexible and modular geometric optimization design that converts any Euclidean optimizer to a Riemannian one. It enables efficient subspace learning while remaining compatible with existing fine-tuning pipelines. Empirical results across a wide range of downstream tasks, including commonsense reasoning, math and code generation, image classification, and image generation, demonstrate the superior performance of our approach against the recent state-of-the-art variants of LoRA.

However, limited samples make accurate differentiation between normal and abnormal features challenging, and even more so under category-agnostic conditions. Large-scale pre-training of foundation visual encoders has advanced many fields, as the enormous quantity of data helps to learn the general distribution of normal images. We observe that the anomaly amount in an image directly correlates with the difference in the learnt embeddings and utilize this to design a few-shot anomaly detector termed FoundAD. This is done by learning a nonlinear projection operator onto the natural image manifold. The simple operator acts as an effective tool for anomaly detection to characterize and identify out-of-distribution regions in an image. Extensive experiments show that our approach supports multi-class detection and achieves competitive performance while using substantially fewer parameters than prior methods. Backed up by evaluations with multiple foundation encoders, including fresh DINOv3, we believe this idea broadens the perspective on foundation features and advances the field of few-shot anomaly detection.<br>

Although compressive sensing systems such as CASSI improve efficiency, accurate reconstruction is still challenged by severe degradation and loss of fine spectral details. We propose the Flow-Matching-guided Unfolding network (FMU), which, to our knowledge, is the first to integrate flow matching into HSI reconstruction by embedding its generative prior within a deep unfolding framework. To further strengthen the learned dynamics, we introduce a mean velocity loss that enforces global consistency of the flow, leading to a more robust and accurate reconstruction. This hybrid design leverages the interpretability of optimization-based methods and the generative capacity of flow matching. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real datasets show that FMU significantly outperforms existing approaches in reconstruction quality.

While challenging, reconstructing their temporal evolution to decipher underlying dynamic properties is of major interest to scientific research. Existing approaches enable data transport along a temporal axis but are poorly scalable in high dimension and require restrictive assumptions to be met. To address these issues, we propose \textit{\textbf{Multi-Marginal temporal Schrödinger Bridge Matching}} (\textbf{MMtSBM}) \textit{for video generation from unpaired data}, extending the theoretical guarantees and empirical efficiency of Diffusion Schrödinger Bridge Matching (arXiv:archive/2303.16852) by deriving the Iterative Markovian Fitting algorithm to multiple marginals in a novel factorized fashion. Experiments show that MMtSBM retains theoretical properties on toy examples, achieves state-of-the-art performance on real world datasets such as transcriptomic trajectory inference in 100 dimensions, and for the first time recovers couplings and dynamics in very high dimensional image settings.

This paper leverages microscaling floating-point formats, a novel technique designed to address these challenges by reducing the storage and computational overhead associated with numerical representations in LLMs. Unlike traditional floating-point representations that allocate a dedicated scale for each value, microscaling employs a shared scale across a block of values, enabling compact one-byte floating-point representations while maintaining an extended dynamic range. We explore the application of microscaling in the context of 8-bit floating-point formats to significantly reduce memory footprint and computational costs. We tested several configurations of microscaling floats within the GPT-2 LLM architecture, demonstrating that microscaling data formats can achieve competitive accuracy during training and inference, proving its efficacy as a resource-efficient alternative for deploying LLMs at scale.

Most previous symmetry discovery methods are limited to linear symmetries, and recent attempts to discover nonlinear symmetries fail to explicitly get the Lie algebra subspace. In this paper, we propose LieNLSD, which is, to our knowledge, the first method capable of determining the number of infinitesimal generators with nonlinear terms and their explicit expressions. We specify a function library for the infinitesimal group action and aim to solve for its coefficient matrix, proving that its prolongation formula for differential equations, which governs dynamic data, is also linear with respect to the coefficient matrix. By substituting the central differences of the data and the Jacobian matrix of the trained neural network into the infinitesimal criterion, we get a system of linear equations for the coefficient matrix, which can then be solved using SVD. On top quark tagging and a series of dynamic systems, LieNLSD shows qualitative advantages over existing methods and improves the long rollout accuracy of neural PDE solvers by over 20% while applying to guide data augmentation.

Knowledge graphs address these challenges by structuring mass spectrometry data, metabolite information, and their relationships into a connected network (Gaudry et al. 2024). However, effective use of a knowledge graph demands an in-depth understanding of its ontology and its query language syntax. To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system utilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL semantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013). We demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products Knowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural products (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for handling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down complex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent (Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and LangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external tools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process follows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the question is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are forwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to the knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent, which identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized identifiers. In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph Agent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or taxonomies of chemical names, from the user query. Finally, an agent responsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the knowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query. Then, the system executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph and returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b). To assess the performance of MetaboT we have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected answers. In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a baseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that incorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity IDs. This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%, underscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving entities and generating correct SPARQL queries. MetaboT demonstrates promising performance as a conversational question-answering assistant, enabling researchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language queries. By automating the generation and execution of SPARQL queries, it removes technical barriers that have traditionally hindered access to knowledge graphs. Importantly, MetaboT leverages the capabilities of LLMs while maintaining experimentally grounded query generation, ensuring that outputs remain aligned with domain-specific standards and data structures. This approach facilitates data-driven discoveries by bridging the gap between complex semantic technologies and user-friendly interaction.

In this work, we investigate how feedforward LLMs solve two-hop factual recall tasks, which can be expressed compositionally as $g(f(x))$. We first confirm that modern LLMs continue to suffer from the "compositionality gap": i.e. their ability to compute both $z = f(x)$ and $y = g(z)$ does not entail their ability to compute the composition $y = g(f(x))$. Then, using logit lens on their residual stream activations, we identify two processing mechanisms, one which solves tasks $\textit{compositionally}$, computing $f(x)$ along the way to computing $g(f(x))$, and one which solves them $\textit{directly}$, without any detectable signature of the intermediate variable $f(x)$. Finally, we find that which mechanism is employed appears to be related to the embedding space geometry, with the idiomatic mechanism being dominant in cases where there exists a linear mapping from $x$ to $g(f(x))$ in the embedding spaces.

Traditional methods rely on exhaustive enumeration of angles and scales, leading to low efficiency under compound transformations. Meanwhile, most deep learning-based approaches only estimate similarity scores without explicitly modeling geometric pose, making them inadequate for real-world deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight end-to-end framework that reformulates template matching as joint localization and geometric regression, outputting the center coordinates, rotation angle, and independent horizontal and vertical scales. A Template-Aware Dynamic Convolution Module (TDCM) dynamically injects template features at inference to guide generalizable matching. The compact network integrates depthwise separable convolutions and pixel shuffle for efficient matching. To enable geometric-annotation-free training, we introduce a rotation-shear-based augmentation strategy with structure-aware pseudo labels. A lightweight refinement module further improves angle and scale precision via local optimization. Experiments show our 3.07M model achieves high precision and 14ms inference under compound transformations. It also demonstrates strong robustness in small-template and multi-object scenarios, making it highly suitable for deployment in real-time industrial applications.

We present LENOHA (Low Energy, No Hallucination, Leave No One Behind Architecture), a safety-first, local-first system that routes inputs with a high-precision sentence-transformer classifier and returns verbatim answers from a clinician-curated FAQ for clinical queries, eliminating free-text generation in the clinical path. We evaluated two domains (tooth extraction and gastroscopy) using expert-reviewed validation sets (n=400/domain) for thresholding and independent test sets (n=200/domain). Among the four encoders, E5-large-instruct (560M) achieved an overall accuracy of 0.983 (95% CI 0.964-0.991), AUC 0.996, and seven total errors, which were statistically indistinguishable from GPT-4o on this task; Gemini made no errors on this test set. Energy logging shows that the non-generative clinical path consumes ~1.0 mWh per input versus ~168 mWh per small-talk reply from a local 8B SLM, a ~170x difference, while maintaining ~0.10 s latency on a single on-prem GPU.

Some recent works have attempted to simultaneously remove image inconsistencies and perform reconstruction by integrating image degradation modeling into neural 3D scene representations. However, these methods rely heavily on dense observations for robustly optimizing model parameters. To address this issue, we propose to decouple robust reconstruction into two subtasks: restoration and reconstruction, which naturally simplifies the optimization process. To this end, we introduce UniVerse, a unified framework for robust reconstruction based on a video diffusion model. Specifically, UniVerse first converts inconsistent images into initial videos, then uses a specially designed video diffusion model to restore them into consistent images, and finally reconstructs the 3D scenes from these restored images. Compared with case-by-case per-view degradation modeling, the diffusion model learns a general scene prior from large-scale data, making it applicable to diverse image inconsistencies. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the strong generalization capability and superior performance of our method in robust reconstruction. Moreover, UniVerse can control the style of the reconstructed 3D scene. Project page: https://jin-cao-tma.github.io/UniVerse.github.io/<br>

Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models, which are rich in true-world modeling, have shown great promise for high-quality image restoration tasks such as deblurring, demonstrating stronger generative capabilities than CNN and transformer-based methods. However, challenges such as unbearable inference time and compromised fidelity still limit the full potential of the diffusion models. To address this, we introduce FideDiff, a novel single-step diffusion model designed for high-fidelity deblurring. We reformulate motion deblurring as a diffusion-like process where each timestep represents a progressively blurred image, and we train a consistency model that aligns all timesteps to the same clean image. By reconstructing training data with matched blur trajectories, the model learns temporal consistency, enabling accurate one-step deblurring. We further enhance model performance by integrating Kernel ControlNet for blur kernel estimation and introducing adaptive timestep prediction. Our model achieves superior performance on full-reference metrics, surpassing previous diffusion-based methods and matching the performance of other state-of-the-art models. FideDiff offers a new direction for applying pre-trained diffusion models to high-fidelity image restoration tasks, establishing a robust baseline for further advancing diffusion models in real-world industrial applications.

However, current VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations. Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy. Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain, simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods.

Most previous studies have relied on publishers and other databases to analyze bibliographic information. However, these databases have problems, such as missing articles and omitted metadata. Therefore, we adopted a novel approach to extract bibliographic information directly from the article PDFs: we examined 20,549 articles and identified the collaborative papers through a classification process of author affiliation. The analysis explores the temporal evolution of collaboration in AI, highlighting significant changes in collaboration patterns over the past decade. In particular, this study examines the role of key academic and industrial institutions in facilitating these collaborations, focusing on emerging global trends. Additionally, a content analysis using document classification was conducted to examine the type of first author in collaborative research articles and explore the potential differences between collaborative and noncollaborative research articles.

On one hand, short reasoning (underthinking) leads to errors on harder problems that require extended reasoning steps; but, excessively long reasoning (overthinking) can be token-inefficient, generating unnecessary steps even after reaching a correct intermediate solution. We refer to this as under-adaptivity, where the model fails to modulate its response length appropriately given problems of varying difficulty. To address under-adaptivity and strike a balance between under- and overthinking, we propose TRAAC (Think Right with Adaptive, Attentive Compression), an online post-training RL method that leverages the model's self-attention over a long reasoning trajectory to identify important steps and prune redundant ones. TRAAC also estimates difficulty and incorporates it into training rewards, thereby learning to allocate reasoning budget commensurate with example difficulty. Our approach improves accuracy, reduces reasoning steps, and enables adaptive thinking compared to base models and other RL baselines. Across a variety of tasks (AIME, AMC, GPQA-D, BBEH), TRAAC (Qwen3-4B) achieves an average absolute accuracy gain of 8.4% with a relative reduction in reasoning length of 36.8% compared to the base model, and a 7.9% accuracy gain paired with a 29.4% length drop compared to the best RL baseline. TRAAC also shows strong generalization: although our models are trained on math datasets, they show accuracy and efficiency gains on out-of-distribution non-math datasets like GPQA-D, BBEH, and OptimalThinkingBench. Our analysis further verifies that TRAAC provides fine-grained adjustments to thinking budget based on difficulty and that a combination of task-difficulty calibration and attention-based compression yields gains across diverse tasks.<br>

However, these applications often default to comprehensive, lengthy descriptions regardless of context. This leads to inefficient exchanges, as users must go through irrelevant details rather than receiving the specific information they are likely to seek. To deliver more contextually-relevant information, we developed a system that draws on historical BLV users questions. When given an image, our system identifies similar past visual contexts from the VizWiz-LF dataset and uses the associated questions to guide the MLLM generate descriptions more relevant to BLV users. An evaluation with three human labelers who revised 92 context-aware and context-free descriptions showed that context-aware descriptions anticipated and answered users' questions in 76.1% of cases (70 out of 92) and were preferred in 54.4% of comparisons (50 out of 92).

In parallel, reinforcement learning (RL) has broadened exploration and enabled precise multi-objective optimization in protein design. Yet whether RL can push PLMs beyond their pretraining priors to uncover latent sequence-structure-function rules remains unclear. We address this by pairing RL with PLMs across four domains: antimicrobial peptide design, kinase variant optimization, antibody engineering, and inverse folding. Using diverse RL algorithms and model classes, we ask if RL improves sampling efficiency and, more importantly, if it reveals capabilities not captured by supervised learning. Across benchmarks, RL consistently boosts success rates and sample efficiency. Performance follows a three-factor interaction: task headroom, reward fidelity, and policy capacity jointly determine gains. When rewards are accurate and informative, policies have sufficient capacity, and tasks leave room beyond supervised baselines, improvements scale; when rewards are noisy or capacity is constrained, gains saturate despite exploration. This view yields practical guidance for RL in protein design: prioritize reward modeling and calibration before scaling policy size, match algorithm and regularization strength to task difficulty, and allocate capacity where marginal gains are largest.

However, due to the inaccessibility of source domain data, deterministic invariable features cannot be obtained. Current mainstream methods primarily focus on evaluating invariant features in the target domain that closely resemble those in the source domain, subsequently aligning the target domain with the source domain. However, these methods are susceptible to hard samples and influenced by domain bias. In this paper, we propose a Consistent Assistant Domains Transformer for SFDA, abbreviated as CADTrans, which solves the issue by constructing invariable feature representations of domain consistency. Concretely, we develop an assistant domain module for CADTrans to obtain diversified representations from the intermediate aggregated global attentions, which addresses the limitation of existing methods in adequately representing diversity. Based on assistant and target domains, invariable feature representations are obtained by multiple consistent strategies, which can be used to distinguish easy and hard samples. Finally, to align the hard samples to the corresponding easy samples, we construct a conditional multi-kernel max mean discrepancy (CMK-MMD) strategy to distinguish between samples of the same category and those of different categories. Extensive experiments are conducted on various benchmarks such as Office-31, Office-Home, VISDA-C, and DomainNet-126, proving the significant performance improvements achieved by our proposed approaches.

This consistency mechanism helps distinguish biologically meaningful structures from transient and noisy artifacts. A key challenge in this process is to accurately match the corresponding topological features across the predictions in the absence of ground truth. To overcome this, we introduce a novel matching strategy that integrates spatial overlap with global structural alignment, minimizing discrepancies among predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces topological errors, resulting in more robust and accurate segmentations essential for reliable downstream analysis.

To reduce contrast agent use, recent deep learning methods have focused on generating synthetic CECT from non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans. However, most adopt a multi-stage pipeline that first generates images and then performs segmentation, which leads to error accumulation and fails to leverage shared semantic and anatomical structures. To address this, we propose a unified deep learning framework that generates synthetic CECT images from NCCT scans while simultaneously segmenting the aortic lumen and thrombus. Our approach integrates conditional diffusion models (CDM) with multi-task learning, enabling end-to-end joint optimization of image synthesis and anatomical segmentation. Unlike previous multitask diffusion models, our approach requires no initial predictions (e.g., a coarse segmentation mask), shares both encoder and decoder parameters across tasks, and employs a semi-supervised training strategy to learn from scans with missing segmentation labels, a common constraint in real-world clinical data. We evaluated our method on a cohort of 264 patients, where it consistently outperformed state-of-the-art single-task and multi-stage models. For image synthesis, our model achieved a PSNR of 25.61 dB, compared to 23.80 dB from a single-task CDM. For anatomical segmentation, it improved the lumen Dice score to 0.89 from 0.87 and the challenging thrombus Dice score to 0.53 from 0.48 (nnU-Net). These segmentation enhancements led to more accurate clinical measurements, reducing the lumen diameter MAE to 4.19 mm from 5.78 mm and the thrombus area error to 33.85% from 41.45% when compared to nnU-Net.

However, there is presently no way to benchmark the performance of LLMs at this task. To fill this void, we introduce AIReg-Bench: the first benchmark dataset designed to test how well LLMs can assess compliance with the EU AI Act (AIA). We created this dataset through a two-step process: (1) by prompting an LLM with carefully structured instructions, we generated 120 technical documentation excerpts (samples), each depicting a fictional, albeit plausible, AI system - of the kind an AI provider might produce to demonstrate their compliance with AIR; (2) legal experts then reviewed and annotated each sample to indicate whether, and in what way, the AI system described therein violates specific Articles of the AIA. The resulting dataset, together with our evaluation of whether frontier LLMs can reproduce the experts' compliance labels, provides a starting point to understand the opportunities and limitations of LLM-based AIR compliance assessment tools and establishes a benchmark against which subsequent LLMs can be compared. The dataset and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/camlsys/aireg-bench.<br>

In this paper, a structure-free evaluation method is presented. The method makes use of semantic embedding distances to match target candidates with arbitrary LM-generated text, resulting in a robust classification of the response at a relatively low compute cost (embedding models of less than $10B$ parameters).

While efficient alternatives to Softmax Attention have been widely studied, the search for more expressive mechanisms grounded in theoretical insight-even at greater computational cost-has been relatively underexplored. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing Local Linear Attention (LLA), a novel attention mechanism derived from nonparametric statistics through the lens of test-time regression. First, we show that LLA offers theoretical advantages over Linear and Softmax Attention for associative memory via a bias-variance trade-off analysis. Next, we address its computational challenges and propose two memory-efficient primitives to tackle the $Θ(n^2 d)$ and $Θ(n d^2)$ complexity. We then introduce FlashLLA, a hardware-efficient, blockwise algorithm that enables scalable and parallel computation on modern accelerators. In addition, we implement and profile a customized inference kernel that significantly reduces memory overheads. Finally, we empirically validate the advantages and limitations of LLA on test-time regression, in-context regression, associative recall and state tracking tasks. Experiment results demonstrate that LLA effectively adapts to non-stationarity, outperforming strong baselines in test-time training and in-context learning, and exhibiting promising evidence for its scalability and applicability in large-scale models.

As skills develop, the type and frequency of struggles tend to change, and understanding this evolution is key to determining the user's current stage of learning. However, existing manipulation datasets have not focused on how struggle evolves over time. In this work, we collect a dataset for struggle determination, featuring 61.68 hours of video recordings, 2,793 videos, and 5,385 annotated temporal struggle segments collected from 76 participants. The dataset includes 18 tasks grouped into four diverse activities -- tying knots, origami, tangram puzzles, and shuffling cards, representing different task variations. In addition, participants repeated the same task five times to capture their evolution of skill. We define the struggle determination problem as a temporal action localization task, focusing on identifying and precisely localizing struggle segments with start and end times. Experimental results show that Temporal Action Localization models can successfully learn to detect struggle cues, even when evaluated on unseen tasks or activities. The models attain an overall average mAP of 34.56% when generalizing across tasks and 19.24% across activities, indicating that struggle is a transferable concept across various skill-based tasks while still posing challenges for further improvement in struggle detection.

At the same time, various methods have been developed to detect general prompt injection attacks, but none have been systematically evaluated for web agents. In this work, we bridge this gap by presenting the first comprehensive benchmark study on detecting prompt injection attacks targeting web agents. We begin by introducing a fine-grained categorization of such attacks based on the threat model. We then construct datasets containing both malicious and benign samples: malicious text segments generated by different attacks, benign text segments from four categories, malicious images produced by attacks, and benign images from two categories. Next, we systematize both text-based and image-based detection methods. Finally, we evaluate their performance across multiple scenarios. Our key findings show that while some detectors can identify attacks that rely on explicit textual instructions or visible image perturbations with moderate to high accuracy, they largely fail against attacks that omit explicit instructions or employ imperceptible perturbations.

Fine-tuning is a widely used method for adapting models to downstream tasks, yet it is vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. However, most existing studies focus on overly simplified attack scenarios, limiting their practical relevance to real-world defense settings. To make this risk concrete, we present a three-pronged jailbreak attack and evaluate it against provider defenses under a dataset-only black-box fine-tuning interface. In this setting, the attacker can only submit fine-tuning data to the provider, while the provider may deploy defenses across stages: (1) pre-upload data filtering, (2) training-time defensive fine-tuning, and (3) post-training safety audit. Our attack combines safety-styled prefix/suffix wrappers, benign lexical encodings (underscoring) of sensitive tokens, and a backdoor mechanism, enabling the model to learn harmful behaviors while individual datapoints appear innocuous. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. In real-world deployment, our method successfully jailbreaks GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o on the OpenAI platform with attack success rates above 97% for both models.

Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks, existing VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception and reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance these capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant constraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction Learning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to progressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates executable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the environment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion. Through this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model incrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via exploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only substantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g., increasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\times$ 2 setting) but also demonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an average improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in both perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an efficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement learning data.

To capture biologically meaningful patterns consistent with known cellular morphologies, MorphGen is trained with an alignment loss to match its representations to the phenotypic embeddings of OpenPhenom, a state-of-the-art biological foundation model.

These methods fail to capture the emergent social and cognitive dynamics that arise when agents communicate, persuade, and collaborate in interactive environments. To address this gap, we introduce a novel evaluation framework that uses multi-agent debate as a controlled "social laboratory" to discover and quantify these behaviors. In our framework, LLM-based agents, instantiated with distinct personas and incentives, deliberate on a wide range of challenging topics under the supervision of an LLM moderator. Our analysis, enabled by a new suite of psychometric and semantic metrics, reveals several key findings. Across hundreds of debates, we uncover a powerful and robust emergent tendency for agents to seek consensus, consistently reaching high semantic agreement (μ > 0.88) even without explicit instruction and across sensitive topics. We show that assigned personas induce stable, measurable psychometric profiles, particularly in cognitive effort, and that the moderators persona can significantly alter debate outcomes by structuring the environment, a key finding for external AI alignment. This work provides a blueprint for a new class of dynamic, psychometrically grounded evaluation protocols designed for the agentic setting, offering a crucial methodology for understanding and shaping the social behaviors of the next generation of AI agents.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) emerges as a critical enabler, providing standardized communication between LLMs and physical devices. We propose IoT-MCP, a novel framework that implements MCP through edge-deployed servers to bridge LLMs and IoT ecosystems. To support rigorous evaluation, we introduce IoT-MCP Bench, the first benchmark containing 114 Basic Tasks (e.g., ``What is the current temperature?'') and 1,140 Complex Tasks (e.g., ``I feel so hot, do you have any ideas?'') for IoT-enabled LLMs. Experimental validation across 22 sensor types and 6 microcontroller units demonstrates IoT-MCP's 100% task success rate to generate tool calls that fully meet expectations and obtain completely accurate results, 205ms average response time, and 74KB peak memory footprint. This work delivers both an open-source integration framework (https://github.com/Duke-CEI-Center/IoT-MCP-Servers) and a standardized evaluation methodology for LLM-IoT systems.<br>

Across 80 seeded iterations per scenario, we test several harm domains including ZIP-bomb construction (cyber threat), synthetic card-number generation, minor-unsafe driving advice, drug-precursor indicators, and RAG context exfiltration. Composite prompts that combine an educator persona, a safety-pretext ("what to avoid"), and step-cue phrasing flip assistance rates from 0% to 97.5% on a ZIP-bomb task. On our grid, formal registers in German and French are often leakier than matched English prompts. A "Linux terminal" role-play overrides a developer rule not to reveal context in a majority of runs with a naive developer prompt, and we introduce an AI-assisted hardening method that reduces leakage to 0% in several user-prompt variants. We further test evaluation awareness with a paired-track design and measure frame-conditioned differences between matched "helpfulness" and "harmfulness" evaluation prompts; we observe inconsistent assistance in 13% of pairs. Finally, we find that the OpenAI Moderation API under-captures materially helpful outputs relative to a semantic grader, and that refusal rates differ by 5 to 10 percentage points across inference stacks, raising reproducibility concerns.

We first leverage large models' understanding and generation capabilities to produce multimodal information and mask motion sequences for multiple subjects across various types. Then, the obtained prior mask sequences are fed into a pretrained mask-driven video generation model to synthesize the edited video. With strong generalization capability, IMAGEdit remedies insufficient prompt-side multimodal conditioning and overcomes mask boundary entanglement in videos with any number of subjects, thereby significantly expanding the applicability of video editing. More importantly, IMAGEdit is compatible with any mask-driven video generation model, significantly improving overall performance.

Inspired by this mental process, we present EvoWorld: a world model that bridges panoramic video generation with evolving 3D memory to enable spatially consistent long-horizon exploration. Given a single panoramic image as input, EvoWorld first generates future video frames by leveraging a video generator with fine-grained view control, then evolves the scene's 3D reconstruction using a feedforward plug-and-play transformer, and finally synthesizes futures by conditioning on geometric reprojections from this evolving explicit 3D memory. Unlike prior state-of-the-arts that synthesize videos only, our key insight lies in exploiting this evolving 3D reconstruction as explicit spatial guidance for the video generation process, projecting the reconstructed geometry onto target viewpoints to provide rich spatial cues that significantly enhance both visual realism and geometric consistency. To evaluate long-range exploration capabilities, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark spanning synthetic outdoor environments, Habitat indoor scenes, and challenging real-world scenarios, with particular emphasis on loop-closure detection and spatial coherence over extended trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our evolving 3D memory substantially improves visual fidelity and maintains spatial scene coherence compared to existing approaches, representing a significant advance toward long-horizon spatially consistent world modeling.<br>

We solve this problem with a sample-efficient Combinatorial Bayesian Optimization algorithm (COM-BOM) to find the Pareto front that optimally trades off the two objectives of accuracy and calibration.

Intuitively, such requirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable environment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g., code). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for generating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework comprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture content into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual assets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable Python codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency; and (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support systematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced, discipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse dimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and particularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a VLM, after unlearning, can recover knowledge by watching the generated videos. Our results demonstrate the potential of Code2Video as a scalable, interpretable, and controllable approach, achieving 40% improvement over direct code generation and producing videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials.

Model editing offers a lightweight alternative to retraining, but sequential editing often destabilizes representations and induces catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we seek to better understand and mitigate performance degradation caused by sequential editing. We hypothesize that hyperspherical uniformity, a property that maintains uniform distribution of neuron weights on a hypersphere, helps the model remain stable, retain prior knowledge, while still accommodate new updates. We use Hyperspherical Energy (HE) to quantify neuron uniformity during editing, and examine its correlation with editing performance. Empirical studies across widely used editing methods reveals a strong correlation between HE dynamics and editing performance, with editing failures consistently coinciding with high HE fluctuations. We further theoretically prove that HE dynamics impose a lower bound on the degradation of pretrained knowledge, highlighting why HE stability is crucial for knowledge retention. Motivated by these insights, we propose SPHERE (Sparse Projection for Hyperspherical Energy-Regularized Editing), an HE-driven regularization strategy that stabilizes neuron weight distributions, ultimately preserving prior knowledge while enabling reliable sequential updates. Specifically, SPHERE identifies a sparse space complementary to the principal hyperspherical directions of the pretrained weight matrices and projects new knowledge onto it, attenuating perturbations on the principal directions. Extensive experiments on LLaMA3 (8B) and Qwen2.5 (7B) show that SPHERE outperforms the best baseline in editing capability by an average of 16.41%, while most faithfully preserving general model performance, thereby offering a principled path toward reliable large-scale knowledge editing.<br>

Unlike prior work that attributes this effect to algorithmic limitations, we identify a fundamental, pervasive data-level driver: typicality bias in preference data, whereby annotators systematically favor familiar text as a result of well-established findings in cognitive psychology. We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference datasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple, training-free prompting strategy to circumvent mode collapse. VS prompts the model to verbalize a probability distribution over a set of responses (e.g., "Generate 5 jokes about coffee and their corresponding probabilities"). Comprehensive experiments show that VS significantly improves performance across creative writing (poems, stories, jokes), dialogue simulation, open-ended QA, and synthetic data generation, without sacrificing factual accuracy and safety. For instance, in creative writing, VS increases diversity by 1.6-2.1x over direct prompting. We further observe an emergent trend that more capable models benefit more from VS. In sum, our work provides a new data-centric perspective on mode collapse and a practical inference-time remedy that helps unlock pre-trained generative diversity.<br>

We seek to answer what it would take to simultaneously align a model across various domains spanning those with: verifiable rewards (mathematical accuracy), non-verifiable subjective preferences (human values), and complex interactive scenarios (multi-turn AI tutoring dialogues). Such multi-objective reinforcement learning setups are often plagued by the individual objectives being at odds with each other, resulting in inefficient training and little user control during inference. We propose a unified framework that: (i) standardizes {process reward model} (PRM) training across both verifiable and non-verifiable settings to better supervise models' chain-of-thought reasoning; (ii) performs {multi-objective alignment} by training the LLM with our $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$ction-$\textbf{H}$ead $\textbf{DPO}$ (MAH-DPO) and a vectorized reward where the dimensions of the vector correspond to the various objectives instead of a single scalar; and (iii) demonstrates how such a system provides fine-grained inference-time user control. Experiments across math reasoning, value alignment, and multi-turn dialogue show that our framework improves performance across multiple objectives simultaneously, while minimizing cross-objective trade-offs and enabling flexible inference time user control.

When no ground-truth trajectories are available, but one has only snapshots of data taken at discrete time steps, the problem of modelling the dynamics, and thus inferring the underlying trajectories, can be solved by multi-marginal generalisations of flow matching algorithms. This paper proposes a novel flow matching method that overcomes the limitations of existing multi-marginal trajectory inference algorithms. Our proposed method, ALI-CFM, uses a GAN-inspired adversarial loss to fit neurally parametrised interpolant curves between source and target points such that the marginal distributions at intermediate time points are close to the observed distributions. The resulting interpolants are smooth trajectories that, as we show, are unique under mild assumptions. These interpolants are subsequently marginalised by a flow matching algorithm, yielding a trained vector field for the underlying dynamics. We showcase the versatility and scalability of our method by outperforming the existing baselines on spatial transcriptomics and cell tracking datasets, while performing on par with them on single-cell trajectory prediction.

Despite rapid progress, existing frameworks and definitions are fragmented, and there is no systematic formulation or analysis of which design choices matter across tasks. We address this gap by first breaking down the design space into three inter-related pillars -- environment, reward, and policy -- and empirically derive a recipe for training LLM agents in situated textual domains. In particular, we test TextWorld and ALFWorld, popular domains for testing situated embodied reasoning, as well as SWE-Gym for more software engineering style tasks. (i) For the environment, we analyze the impacts of task complexity in terms of sizes of the state and action spaces as well as optimal solution length, finding that even simple environments within a domain can provide signal on how well an agent can generalize to more complex tasks. (ii) For the reward, we ablate relative reward sparsity, observing that while dense turn-level rewards accelerate training, performance and stability is highly dependent on the choice of RL algorithm. (iii) And for the agent's policy, we explore the interplay between reward sparsity and biased (PPO, GRPO) and unbiased (RLOO) policy gradient methods in addition to showing how to find the optimal Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to RL training ratio given a fixed budget. We distill these findings into a training recipe that guides co-design across the three pillars, facilitating research and practical efforts in multi-turn agentic RL.

When tackling real-world applications with reinforcement learning method, the corresponded Markov decision process may have huge discrete or even continuous state/action space. Deep reinforcement learning has been studied for handling these issues through deep learning for years, and one promising branch is the actor-critic architecture. Many past studies leveraged multiple critics to enhance the accuracy of evaluation of a policy for addressing the overestimation and underestimation issues. However, few studies have considered the architecture with multiple actors together with multiple critics. This study proposes a novel multi-actor multi-critic (MAMC) deep deterministic reinforcement learning method. The proposed method has three main features, including selection of actors based on non-dominated sorting for exploration with respect to skill and creativity factors, evaluation for actors and critics using a quantile-based ensemble strategy, and exploiting actors with best skill factor.

We propose \textbf{JEPA-T}, a unified multimodal framework that encodes images and captions into discrete visual and textual tokens, processed by a joint-embedding predictive Transformer. To enhance fusion, we incorporate cross-attention after the feature predictor for conditional denoising while maintaining a task-agnostic backbone. Additionally, raw texts embeddings are injected prior to the flow matching loss to improve alignment during training. During inference, the same network performs both class-conditional and free-text image generation by iteratively denoising visual tokens conditioned on text. Evaluations on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that JEPA-T achieves strong data efficiency, open-vocabulary generalization, and consistently outperforms non-fusion and late-fusion baselines. Our approach shows that late architectural fusion combined with objective-level alignment offers an effective balance between conditioning strength and backbone generality in token-based T2I.The code is now available: https://github.com/justin-herry/JEPA-T.git<br>

Existing video super-resolution (VSR) approaches, however, face two persistent challenges when processing long sequences: (1) inefficiency due to the heavy cost of multi-step denoising for full-length sequences; and (2) poor scalability hindered by temporal decomposition that causes artifacts and discontinuities. To break these limits, we propose InfVSR, which novelly reformulates VSR as an autoregressive-one-step-diffusion paradigm. This enables streaming inference while fully leveraging pre-trained video diffusion priors. First, we adapt the pre-trained DiT into a causal structure, maintaining both local and global coherence via rolling KV-cache and joint visual guidance. Second, we distill the diffusion process into a single step efficiently, with patch-wise pixel supervision and cross-chunk distribution matching. Together, these designs enable efficient and scalable VSR for unbounded-length videos. To fill the gap in long-form video evaluation, we build a new benchmark tailored for extended sequences and further introduce semantic-level metrics to comprehensively assess temporal consistency. Our method pushes the frontier of long-form VSR, achieves state-of-the-art quality with enhanced semantic consistency, and delivers up to 58x speed-up over existing methods such as MGLD-VSR.

These approaches typically decompose into two components: Density Ratio (DR) estimation $\frac{ρ_E}{ρ_π}$, where a discriminator estimates the relative occupancy of state-action pairs under the policy versus the expert; and Reward Assignment (RA), where this ratio is transformed into a reward signal used to train the policy. While significant research has focused on improving density estimation, the role of reward assignment in influencing training dynamics and final policy performance has been largely overlooked. RA functions in AIL are typically derived from divergence minimization objectives, relying heavily on human design and ingenuity. In this work, we take a different approach: we investigate the discovery of data-driven RA functions, i.e, based directly on the performance of the resulting imitation policy. To this end, we leverage an LLM-guided evolutionary framework that efficiently explores the space of RA functions, yielding \emph{Discovered Adversarial Imitation Learning} (DAIL), the first meta-learnt AIL algorithm. Remarkably, DAIL generalises across unseen environments and policy optimization algorithms, outperforming the current state-of-the-art of \emph{human-designed} baselines. Finally, we analyse why DAIL leads to more stable training, offering novel insights into the role of RA functions in the stability of AIL.

While several deep learning methods have been proposed for facial landmark localization, most focus on pseudo-landmarks or require complex input representations, limiting their clinical applicability. This study presents a fully automated deep learning pipeline (PAL-Net) for localizing 50 anatomical landmarks on stereo-photogrammetry facial models. The method combines coarse alignment, region-of-interest filtering, and an initial approximation of landmarks with a patch-based pointwise CNN enhanced by attention mechanisms. Trained and evaluated on 214 annotated scans from healthy adults, PAL-Net achieved a mean localization error of 3.686 mm and preserves relevant anatomical distances with a 2.822 mm average error, comparable to intra-observer variability. To assess generalization, the model was further evaluated on 700 subjects from the FaceScape dataset, achieving a point-wise error of 0.41\,mm and a distance-wise error of 0.38\,mm. Compared to existing methods, PAL-Net offers a favorable trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. While performance degrades in regions with poor mesh quality (e.g., ears, hairline), the method demonstrates consistent accuracy across most anatomical regions. PAL-Net generalizes effectively across datasets and facial regions, outperforming existing methods in both point-wise and structural evaluations. It provides a lightweight, scalable solution for high-throughput 3D anthropometric analysis, with potential to support clinical workflows and reduce reliance on manual annotation.

Although attention mechanisms such as Transformers have since dominated due to their ability to model global context, their quadratic complexity and limited scalability make them less suited for long sequences. Video super-resolution (VSR) methods have traditionally relied on recurrent architectures to propagate features across frames. However, such approaches suffer from well-known issues including vanishing gradients, lack of parallelism, and slow inference speed. Recent advances in selective SSMs like Mamba offer a compelling alternative: by enabling input-dependent state transitions with linear-time complexity, Mamba mitigates these issues while maintaining strong long-range modeling capabilities. Despite this potential, Mamba alone struggles to capture fine-grained spatial dependencies due to its causal nature and lack of explicit context aggregation. To address this, we propose a hybrid architecture that combines shifted window self-attention for spatial context aggregation with Mamba-based selective scanning for efficient temporal propagation. Furthermore, we introduce Gather-Scatter Mamba (GSM), an alignment-aware mechanism that warps features toward a center anchor frame within the temporal window before Mamba propagation and scatters them back afterward, effectively reducing occlusion artifacts and ensuring effective redistribution of aggregated information across all frames.

Prior safety benchmarks have primarily focused on preventing generation of harmful content, such as toxic text. However, they overlook the challenge of agents taking harmful actions when the most effective path to an operational goal conflicts with human safety. To address this gap, we introduce ManagerBench, a benchmark that evaluates LLM decision-making in realistic, human-validated managerial scenarios. Each scenario forces a choice between a pragmatic but harmful action that achieves an operational goal, and a safe action that leads to worse operational performance. A parallel control set, where potential harm is directed only at inanimate objects, measures a model's pragmatism and identifies its tendency to be overly safe. Our findings indicate that the frontier LLMs perform poorly when navigating this safety-pragmatism trade-off. Many consistently choose harmful options to advance their operational goals, while others avoid harm only to become overly safe and ineffective. Critically, we find this misalignment does not stem from an inability to perceive harm, as models' harm assessments align with human judgments, but from flawed prioritization. ManagerBench is a challenging benchmark for a core component of agentic behavior: making safe choices when operational goals and alignment values incentivize conflicting actions.

These approaches train ControlNet or LoRA modules while keeping the pre-trained model fixed, which often introduces over-enhanced artifacts and hallucinations, suffering from the robustness to inputs of varying degradations. Recent visual autoregressive (AR) models, such as pre-trained Infinity, can provide strong T2I generation capabilities while offering superior efficiency by using the bitwise next-scale prediction strategy. Building upon next-scale prediction, we introduce a robust Real-ISR framework, namely Next-Scale Autoregressive Modeling (NSARM). Specifically, we train NSARM in two stages: a transformation network is first trained to map the input low-quality image to preliminary scales, followed by an end-to-end full-model fine-tuning. Such a comprehensive fine-tuning enhances the robustness of NSARM in Real-ISR tasks without compromising its generative capability. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that as a pure AR model, NSARM achieves superior visual results over existing Real-ISR methods while maintaining a fast inference speed. Most importantly, it demonstrates much higher robustness to the quality of input images, showing stronger generalization performance. Project page: https://github.com/Xiangtaokong/NSARM<br>

Unlike conventional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches that prioritize optimization of a single trajectory, GFlowNets seek to balance diversity and reward by modeling the entire trajectory distribution. This capability makes them especially suitable for domains such as molecular design and combinatorial optimization. However, existing GFlowNets sampling strategies tend to overexplore and struggle to consistently generate high-reward samples, particularly in large search spaces with sparse high-reward regions. Therefore, improving the probability of generating high-reward samples without sacrificing diversity remains a key challenge under this premise. In this work, we integrate an enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into the GFlowNets sampling process, using MCTS-based policy evaluation to guide the generation toward high-reward trajectories and Polynomial Upper Confidence Trees (PUCT) to balance exploration and exploitation adaptively, and we introduce a controllable mechanism to regulate the degree of greediness. Our method enhances exploitation without sacrificing diversity by dynamically balancing exploration and reward-driven guidance. The experimental results show that our method can not only accelerate the speed of discovering high-reward regions but also continuously generate high-reward samples, while preserving the diversity of the generative distribution.

However, these methods require training a surrogate loss or diffusion models to produce adversarial samples, which limits their applicability in real-world settings. Thus, we propose a Zero Query Black-box Adversarial (ZQBA) attack that exploits the representations of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to fool other networks. Instead of requiring thousands of queries to produce deceiving adversarial samples, we use the feature maps obtained from a DNN and add them to clean images to impair the classification of a target model. The results suggest that ZQBA can transfer the adversarial samples to different models and across various datasets, namely CIFAR and Tiny ImageNet. The experiments also show that ZQBA is more effective than state-of-the-art black-box attacks with a single query, while maintaining the imperceptibility of perturbations, evaluated both quantitatively (SSIM) and qualitatively, emphasizing the vulnerabilities of employing DNNs in real-world contexts.

While incorporating historical context through attention mechanisms can improve robustness, standard approaches process all past states in a sequence without explicitly modeling the temporal structure that demonstrations may include, such as failure and recovery patterns. We propose a Cross-State Transition Attention Transformer that employs a novel State Transition Attention (STA) mechanism to modulate standard attention weights based on learned state evolution patterns, enabling policies to better adapt their behavior based on execution history. Our approach combines this structured attention with temporal masking during training, where visual information is randomly removed from recent timesteps to encourage temporal reasoning from historical context.

Methods based on prototypical case-based reasoning have shown a promising improvement in explainability.

Multiple critiques have been raised about the reliability and quality of such techniques. For this reason, we study the use of prominent image segmentation foundation models to improve the truthfulness of the mapping between embedding and input space. We aim to restrict the computation area of the saliency map to a predefined semantic image patch to reduce the uncertainty of such visualizations. To perceive the information of an entire image, we use the bounding box from each generated segmentation mask to crop the image. Each mask results in an individual input in our novel model architecture named ProtoMask.

While numerous tools exist for detecting unused dependencies in Python, removing these dependencies across the source code and configuration files of a project requires manual effort and expertise. To tackle this challenge we introduce PYTRIM, an end-to-end system to automate this process. PYTRIM eliminates unused imports and package declarations across a variety of file types, including Python source and configuration files such as requirements.txt and setup.py. PYTRIM's modular design makes it agnostic to the source of dependency bloat information, enabling integration with any detection tool. Beyond its contribution when it comes to automation, PYTRIM also incorporates a novel dynamic analysis component that improves dependency detection recall. Our evaluation of PYTRIM's end-to-end effectiveness on a ground-truth dataset of 37 merged pull requests from prior work, shows that PYTRIM achieves 98.3% accuracy in replicating human-made changes. To show its practical impact, we run PYTRIM on 971 open-source packages, identifying and trimming bloated dependencies in 39 of them. For each case, we submit a corresponding pull request, 6 of which have already been accepted and merged. PYTRIM is available as an open-source project, encouraging community contributions and further development.

However, accurately treating brain-related conditions requires a comprehensive understanding of the cerebrovascular tree, regardless of the specific acquisition procedure. Our framework effectively segments brain arteries and veins in various datasets through image-to-image translation while avoiding domain-specific model design and data harmonization between the source and the target domain. This is accomplished by employing disentanglement techniques to independently manipulate different image properties, allowing them to move from one domain to another in a label-preserving manner. Specifically, we focus on manipulating vessel appearances during adaptation while preserving spatial information, such as shapes and locations, which are crucial for correct segmentation. Our evaluation effectively bridges large and varied domain gaps across medical centers, image modalities, and vessel types. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies on the optimal number of required annotations and other architectural choices. The results highlight our framework's robustness and versatility, demonstrating the potential of domain adaptation methodologies to perform cerebrovascular image segmentation in multiple scenarios accurately.

Consistency Models (CMs), which are trained to be consistent on diffusion or probability flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) trajectories, enable one or two-step flow or diffusion sampling. However, CMs typically require prolonged training with large batch sizes to obtain competitive sample quality. In this paper, we examine the training dynamics of CMs near convergence and discover that CM tangents -- CM output update directions -- are quite oscillatory, in the sense that they move parallel to the data manifold, not towards the manifold. To mitigate oscillatory tangents, we propose a new loss function, called the manifold feature distance (MFD), which provides manifold-aligned tangents that point toward the data manifold. Consequently, our method -- dubbed Align Your Tangent (AYT) -- can accelerate CM training by orders of magnitude and even out-perform the learned perceptual image patch similarity metric (LPIPS). Furthermore, we find that our loss enables training with extremely small batch sizes without compromising sample quality. Code: https://github.com/1202kbs/AYT<br>

Despite the capabilities of large vision-language models, alt-text generation performance remains limited due to noisy user annotations, inconsistent standards, and MLLMs' insensitivity to contextual information. Previous efforts to fine-tune MLLMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) have struggled, as SFT relies on accurate target annotations, which are often flawed in user-generated alt-text. To address this, we propose Multi-faceted Cross-modal Direct Preference Optimization (MCM-DPO), which improves alt-text generation by learning to identify better options in preference pairs without requiring precise annotations. MCM-DPO optimizes preferences across single, paired, and multi-preference dimensions, covering textual, visual, and cross-modal factors. In light of the scarcity of high-quality annotated and preference-labeled datasets for alt-text, we constructed two large-scale, high-quality datasets named TAlt and PAlt, sourced from Twitter and Pinterest. These datasets include 202k annotated alt-text samples and 18k preference pairs that cover diverse preference dimensions, aiming to support further research in this domain. Experimental results show that our proposed MCM-DPO method consistently outperforms both DPO and SFT, establishing a new state of the art in alt-text generation.

Diffusion models have recently demonstrated strong performance in probabilistic trajectory prediction, but their large model size and slow sampling process hinder real-world deployment. This paper proposes Collaborative-Distilled Diffusion Models (CDDM), a novel method for real-time and lightweight trajectory prediction. Built upon Collaborative Progressive Distillation (CPD), CDDM progressively transfers knowledge from a high-capacity teacher diffusion model to a lightweight student model, jointly reducing both the number of sampling steps and the model size across distillation iterations. A dual-signal regularized distillation loss is further introduced to incorporate guidance from both the teacher and ground-truth data, mitigating potential overfitting and ensuring robust performance. Extensive experiments on the ETH-UCY pedestrian benchmark and the nuScenes vehicle benchmark demonstrate that CDDM achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy. The well-distilled CDDM retains 96.2% and 95.5% of the baseline model's ADE and FDE performance on pedestrian trajectories, while requiring only 231K parameters and 4 or 2 sampling steps, corresponding to 161x compression, 31x acceleration, and 9 ms latency. Qualitative results further show that CDDM generates diverse and accurate trajectories under dynamic agent behaviors and complex social interactions. By bridging high-performing generative models with practical deployment constraints, CDDM enables resource-efficient probabilistic prediction for AVs and ITS.

These manual efforts limit scalability, reproducibility, and cross-institutional generalization. To address this, we introduce EMR-AGENT (Automated Generalized Extraction and Navigation Tool), an agent-based framework that replaces manual rule writing with dynamic, language model-driven interaction to extract and standardize structured clinical data. Our framework automates cohort selection, feature extraction, and code mapping through interactive querying of databases. Our modular agents iteratively observe query results and reason over schema and documentation, using SQL not just for data retrieval but also as a tool for database observation and decision making. This eliminates the need for hand-crafted, schema-specific logic. To enable rigorous evaluation, we develop a benchmarking codebase for three EMR databases (MIMIC-III, eICU, SICdb), including both seen and unseen schema settings. Our results demonstrate strong performance and generalization across these databases, highlighting the feasibility of automating a process previously thought to require expert-driven design.

We trace this limitation to its default training objective: negative log likelihood (NLL). While NLL is classically optimal when training from scratch, post-training operates in a different paradigm and could violate its optimality assumptions, where models already encode task-relevant priors and supervision can be long and noisy. To this end, we study a general family of probability-based objectives and characterize their effectiveness under different conditions. Through comprehensive experiments and extensive ablation studies across 7 model backbones, 14 benchmarks, and 3 domains, we uncover a critical dimension that governs objective behavior: the model-capability continuum. Near the model-strong end, prior-leaning objectives that downweight low-probability tokens (e.g., $-p$, $-p^{10}$, thresholded variants) consistently outperform NLL; toward the model-weak end, NLL dominates; in between, no single objective prevails. Our theoretical analysis further elucidates how objectives trade places across the continuum, providing a principled foundation for adapting objectives to model capability.

We observe an inverse correlation between response copying degree and context-unfaithful hallucinations on RAGTruth, suggesting that higher copying degrees reduce hallucinations by fostering genuine contextual belief. We propose CopyPasteLLM, obtained through two-stage high-copying response preference training. We design three prompting methods to enhance copying degree, demonstrating that high-copying responses achieve superior contextual faithfulness and hallucination control. These approaches enable a fully automated pipeline that transforms generated responses into high-copying preference data for training CopyPasteLLM. On FaithEval, ConFiQA and PubMedQA, CopyPasteLLM achieves best performance in both counterfactual and original contexts, remarkably with 12.2% to 24.5% accuracy improvements on FaithEval over the best baseline, while requiring only 365 training samples -- 1/50th of baseline data. To elucidate CopyPasteLLM's effectiveness, we propose the Context-Parameter Copying Capturing algorithm. Interestingly, this reveals that CopyPasteLLM recalibrates reliance on internal parametric knowledge rather than external knowledge during generation.

Though image-based selection approaches have shown promise, their feature extraction techniques might encode distinct matrices into identical image representations, leading to the same selection and suboptimal method. In this paper, we introduce RAF (Relative-Absolute Fusion), an efficient feature extraction technique to enhance image-based selection approaches. By simultaneously extracting and fusing image representations as relative features with corresponding numerical values as absolute features, RAF achieves comprehensive matrix representations that prevent feature ambiguity across distinct matrices, thus improving selection accuracy and unlocking the potential of image-based selection approaches. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of RAF on SuiteSparse and our developed BMCMat (Balanced Multi-Classification Matrix dataset), demonstrating solution time reductions of 0.08s-0.29s for sparse linear systems, which is 5.86%-11.50% faster than conventional image-based selection approaches and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Previous GAD methods primarily use only normal samples as references, overlooking the valuable information contained in anomalous samples that are often available in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a more practical approach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages both normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection across diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning (NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from normal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly representations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images through residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach effectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and efficient cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing GAD approaches. This work represents the first to adopt a mixture of normal and abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection.

Prior work generally assumes that process reward models (PRMs), which score every intermediate reasoning step, outperform outcome reward models (ORMs) that assess only the final answer. This view is based mainly on evidence from narrow, math-adjacent domains. We present the first unified evaluation of four reward model variants, discriminative ORM and PRM (\DisORM, \DisPRM) and generative ORM and PRM (\GenORM, \GenPRM), across 14 diverse domains. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that (i) \DisORM performs on par with \DisPRM, (ii) \GenPRM is not competitive, and (iii) overall, \GenORM is the most robust, yielding significant and consistent gains across every tested domain. We attribute this to PRM-style stepwise scoring, which inherits label noise from LLM auto-labeling and has difficulty evaluating long reasoning trajectories, including those involving self-correcting reasoning. Our theoretical analysis shows that step-wise aggregation compounds errors as reasoning length grows, and our empirical observations confirm this effect. These findings challenge the prevailing assumption that fine-grained supervision is always better and support generative outcome verification for multi-domain deployment.

Each task presents an incorrect matchstick equation that must be corrected by moving one or two sticks under strict conservation rules. The benchmark includes both text-guided and purely visual settings, systematically covering digit scale, move complexity, solution multiplicity, and operator variation, with 1.4M generated instances and a curated test set. Evaluations of 14 vision--language models reveal substantial limitations: closed-source models succeed only on simple cases, open-source models fail in the visual regime, while humans exceed 90\% accuracy.

This study examines transitions between returners, who repeatedly visit a limited set of locations, and explorers, who travel across broader destinations, over a 15-day emergency period in a densely populated metropolitan region using the YJMob100K dataset. High-resolution spatial data reveal intra-urban behavioral dynamics often masked at coarser scales. Beyond static comparisons, we analyze how mobility evolves over time, with varying emergency durations, across weekdays and weekends, and relative to neighborhood boundaries, linking the analysis to the 15-minute city framework. Results show that at least two weeks of data are required to detect meaningful behavioral shifts. During prolonged emergencies, individuals resume visits to non-essential locations more slowly than under normal conditions. Explorers markedly reduce long distance travel, while weekends and holidays consistently exhibit returner-like, short distance patterns. Residents of low Points of Interest (POI) density neighborhoods often travel to POI rich areas, highlighting spatial disparities. Strengthening local accessibility may improve urban resilience during crises. Full reproducibility is supported through the project website: https://github.com/wissamkontar<br>

Intuitively, the complex time series can be decomposed into two factors, \ie time-invariant and time-varying components, which indicate static and dynamic patterns, respectively. Nonetheless, existing methods often conflate the time-varying and time-invariant components, and jointly learn the combined long-term patterns and short-term fluctuations, leading to suboptimal performance facing distribution shifts. To address this issue, we initiatively propose a lightweight static-dynamic decomposition framework, TimeEmb, for time series forecasting. TimeEmb innovatively separates time series into two complementary components: (1) time-invariant component, captured by a novel global embedding module that learns persistent representations across time series, and (2) time-varying component, processed by an efficient frequency-domain filtering mechanism inspired by full-spectrum analysis in signal processing. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeEmb outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and requires fewer computational resources. We conduct comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses to verify the efficacy of static-dynamic disentanglement. This lightweight framework can also improve existing time-series forecasting methods with simple integration.

However, their performance often degrades under domain shift. We introduce VLOD-TTA, a test-time adaptation (TTA) framework for VLODs that leverages dense proposal overlap and image-conditioned prompt scores. First, an IoU-weighted entropy objective is proposed that concentrates adaptation on spatially coherent proposal clusters and reduces confirmation bias from isolated boxes. Second, image-conditioned prompt selection is introduced, which ranks prompts by image-level compatibility and fuses the most informative prompts with the detector logits. Our benchmarking across diverse distribution shifts -- including stylized domains, driving scenes, low-light conditions, and common corruptions -- shows the effectiveness of our method on two state-of-the-art VLODs, YOLO-World and Grounding DINO, with consistent improvements over the zero-shot and TTA baselines.

However, previous studies have mainly focused on classification or ranking tasks and have not considered Likert-scale rating prediction, a regression task that requires both language and mathematical reasoning to be solved effectively. This task has significant industrial applications, but the utilization of LLMs remains underexplored, particularly regarding the capabilities of off-the-shelf LLMs. This study investigates the performance of off-the-shelf LLMs on rating prediction, providing different in-context information. Through comprehensive experiments with eight models across three datasets, we demonstrate that user-written reviews significantly improve the rating prediction performance of LLMs. This result is comparable to traditional methods like matrix factorization, highlighting the potential of LLMs as a promising solution for the cold-start problem. We also find that the reviews for concrete items are more effective than general preference descriptions that are not based on any specific item. Furthermore, we discover that prompting LLMs to first generate a hypothetical review enhances the rating prediction performance.

While recent advances enable code LLMs to process long inputs, high API costs and generation latency remain substantial bottlenecks. Existing context pruning techniques, such as LLMLingua, achieve promising results for general text but overlook code-specific structures and dependencies, leading to suboptimal performance in programming tasks. In this paper, we propose LongCodeZip, a novel plug-and-play code compression framework designed specifically for code LLMs. LongCodeZip employs a dual-stage strategy: (1) coarse-grained compression, which identifies and ranks function-level chunks using conditional perplexity with respect to the instruction, retaining only the most relevant functions; and (2) fine-grained compression, which segments retained functions into blocks based on perplexity and selects an optimal subset under an adaptive token budget to maximize relevance. Evaluations across multiple tasks, including code completion, summarization, and question answering, show that LongCodeZip consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving up to a 5.6x compression ratio without degrading task performance. By effectively reducing context size while preserving essential information, LongCodeZip enables LLMs to better scale to real-world, large-scale code scenarios, advancing the efficiency and capability of code intelligence applications.<br>

While radiologists effectively utilize available clinical contexts in their diagnostic reasoning, existing SRRG systems overlook these essential elements. This fundamental gap leads to critical problems including temporal hallucinations when referencing non-existent clinical contexts. To address these limitations, we propose contextualized SRRG (C-SRRG) that comprehensively incorporates rich clinical context for SRRG. We curate C-SRRG dataset by integrating comprehensive clinical context encompassing 1) multi-view X-ray images, 2) clinical indication, 3) imaging techniques, and 4) prior studies with corresponding comparisons based on patient histories. Through extensive benchmarking with state-of-the-art multimodal large language models, we demonstrate that incorporating clinical context with the proposed C-SRRG significantly improves report generation quality.

Yet, existing zeroth-order methods rely on hand-crafted, static sampling strategies that are not adaptable to model-specific structures. To address this, we propose ZO Fine-tuner, a learning-based zeroth-order optimizer for LLMs that automatically learns efficient perturbation strategies through a compact and memory-efficient design. Crucially, our approach is motivated by the observation that only a small number of foundation models and their derivatives are widely adopted in practice. Therefore, learning the optimizer once for a given LLM and reusing it across diverse downstream tasks is both feasible and highly desirable. Accordingly, ZO Fine-tuner is designed to scale learning to learn (L2L) to the foundation-model era by supporting one-time training per LLM with minimal overhead. Experiments on 4 LLMs and 7 datasets show that ZO Fine-tuner outperforms prior zeroth-order baselines in 82.1\% of task-model combinations, thereby demonstrating strong performance and scalability for efficient LLM fine-tuning.

While automated deep learning approaches have demonstrated considerable potential, achieving consistently accurate clinical segmentation remains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity. Interactive Medical Image Segmentation (IMIS) addresses this challenge by integrating advanced AI techniques with clinical input. However, generic segmentation tools, despite widespread applicability, often lack the specificity required for clinically critical and disease-specific tasks like meningioma RT planning. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Interactive-MEN-RT, a dedicated IMIS tool specifically developed for clinician-assisted 3D meningioma segmentation in RT workflows. The system incorporates multiple clinically relevant interaction methods, including point annotations, bounding boxes, lasso tools, and scribbles, enhancing usability and clinical precision. In our evaluation involving 500 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans from the BraTS 2025 Meningioma RT Segmentation Challenge, Interactive-MEN-RT demonstrated substantial improvement compared to other segmentation methods, achieving Dice similarity coefficients of up to 77.6\% and Intersection over Union scores of 64.8\%.

Recent Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approaches address this issue by employing GNN encoders to extract graph information and hinge distance measures to ensure containment constraints in the embedding space. These methods significantly shorten the response time, making them promising solutions for subgraph retrieval. However, they suffer from scale differences between graph pairs during encoding, as they focus on feature counts but overlook the relative positions of features within node-rooted subtrees, leading to disturbed containment constraints and false predictions. Additionally, their hinge distance measures lack discriminative power for matched graph pairs, hindering ranking applications. We propose NC-Iso, a novel GNN architecture for neural subgraph matching. NC-Iso preserves the relative positions of features by building the hierarchical dependencies between adjacent echelons within node-rooted subtrees, ensuring matched graph pairs maintain consistent hierarchies while complying with containment constraints in feature counts. To enhance the ranking ability for matched pairs, we introduce a novel similarity dominance ratio-enhanced measure, which quantifies the dominance of similarity over dissimilarity between graph pairs. Empirical results on nine datasets validate the effectiveness, generalization ability, scalability, and transferability of NC-Iso while maintaining time efficiency, offering a more discriminative neural subgraph matching solution for subgraph retrieval.

However, exact computations of these metrics are known to be NP-Hard. Recent neural network-based approaches approximate the similarity score in embedding spaces to alleviate the computational burden, but they either involve expensive pairwise node comparisons or fail to effectively utilize structural and scale information of graphs. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel geometric-based graph embedding method called Graph2Region (G2R). G2R represents nodes as closed regions and recovers their adjacency patterns within graphs in the embedding space. By incorporating the node features and adjacency patterns of graphs, G2R summarizes graph regions, i.e., graph embeddings, where the shape captures the underlying graph structures and the volume reflects the graph size. Consequently, the overlap between graph regions can serve as an approximation of MCS, signifying similar node regions and adjacency patterns. We further analyze the relationship between MCS and GED and propose using disjoint parts as a proxy for GED similarity. This analysis enables concurrent computation of MCS and GED, incorporating local and global structural information. Experimental evaluation highlights G2R's competitive performance in graph similarity computation. It achieves up to a 60.0\% relative accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods in MCS similarity learning, while maintaining efficiency in both training and inference. Moreover, G2R showcases remarkable capability in predicting both MCS and GED similarities simultaneously, providing a holistic assessment of graph similarity.

We present Kanzi, a flow-based tokenizer for tokenization and generation of protein structures. Kanzi consists of a diffusion autoencoder trained with a flow matching loss. We show that this approach simplifies several aspects of protein structure tokenizers: frame-based representations can be replaced with global coordinates, complex losses are replaced with a single flow matching loss, and SE(3)-invariant attention operations can be replaced with standard attention. We find that these changes stabilize the training of parameter-efficient models that outperform existing tokenizers on reconstruction metrics at a fraction of the model size and training cost.

Benefits of better code search include faster new developer on-boarding, reduced software maintenance, and ease of understanding for large repositories. Despite improvements in search algorithms and search benchmarks, the domain of code search has lagged behind. One reason is the high cost of human annotation for code queries and answers. While humans may annotate search results in general text QA systems, code annotations require specialized knowledge of a programming language (PL), as well as domain specific software engineering knowledge. In this work we study the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to retrieve code at the level of functions and to generate annotations for code search results. We compare the impact of the retriever representation (sparse vs. semantic), programming language, and LLM by comparing human annotations across several popular languages (C, Java, Javascript, Go, and Python). We focus on repositories that implement common data structures likely to be implemented in any PLs. For the same human annotations, we compare several LLM-as-a-Judge models to evaluate programming language and other affinities between LLMs. We find that the chosen retriever and PL exhibit affinities that can be leveraged to improve alignment of human and AI relevance determinations, with significant performance implications. We also find differences in representation (sparse vs. semantic) across PLs that impact alignment of human and AI relevance determinations. We propose using transpilers to bootstrap scalable code search benchmark datasets in other PLs and in a case study demonstrate that human-AI relevance agreement rates largely match the (worst case) human-human agreement under study.

While probing classifiers show promise, they operate on isolated layer-token pairs and are LLM-specific, limiting their effectiveness and hindering cross-LLM applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to address these shortcomings. We build on the natural sequential structure of activation data in both axes (layers $\times$ tokens) and advocate treating full activation tensors akin to images. We design ACT-ViT, a Vision Transformer-inspired model that can be effectively and efficiently applied to activation tensors and supports training on data from multiple LLMs simultaneously. Through comprehensive experiments encompassing diverse LLMs and datasets, we demonstrate that ACT-ViT consistently outperforms traditional probing techniques while remaining extremely efficient for deployment. In particular, we show that our architecture benefits substantially from multi-LLM training, achieves strong zero-shot performance on unseen datasets, and can be transferred effectively to new LLMs through fine-tuning.

Unlike traditional classifiers that output label probabilities, ELMs are more versatile, supporting domain-specific tasks (e.g., waveform analysis, diagnosis, prognosis) as well as general tasks (e.g., open-ended questions, dialogue). Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), widely used in Large Language Models (LLMs) to ground LLM outputs in retrieved knowledge, helps reduce hallucinations and improve natural language generation (NLG). However, despite its promise, no open-source implementation or systematic study of RAG pipeline design for ELMs currently exists. To address this gap, we present the first open-source RAG pipeline for ELMs, along with baselines and ablation studies for NLG. Experiments on three public datasets show that ELMs with RAG consistently improves performance over non-RAG baselines and highlights key ELM design considerations.

</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2510.00237">Debunk the Myth of SFT Generalization</a></div></span></div><div id='abs'>Abstract:<br><span id='abs'>A prevailing view holds that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) memorizes training data and fails to generalize, whereas reinforcement learning (RL) attains broader robustness. We revisit this claim through a systematic evaluation on two decision-making benchmarks, Sokoban and General Points, and arrive at a different conclusion. We show that much of SFT's perceived failure stems from frozen-prompt artifacts: when trained on fixed instruction templates, SFT models cling to training semantics rather than adapting to new ones. Introducing prompt diversity during training breaks this shortcut and yields strong generalization to unseen instruction variants without harming in-distribution performance. Beyond instruction shifts, we ask whether SFT can generalize to strictly harder tasks. Here, chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision provides an algorithmic scaffold that markedly improves transfer to more difficult regimes, such as larger Sokoban grids with additional boxes and arithmetic with out-of-distribution values or five-card compositions that increase combinatorial complexity. Finally, combining prompt diversity with CoT achieves the best of both worlds: robust generalization across both instruction-variant and difficulty-variant settings, matching or surpassing RL baselines on our benchmarks while retaining SFT's simplicity and stability. These findings challenge the narrative that SFT is inherently inferior to RL and support a data-centric perspective: with appropriately curated demonstrations, vanilla SFT can generalize as strongly as RL.

Signal Temporal Logic (STL) offers a powerful and expressive language for specifying such tasks, but its non-Markovian nature and inherent sparse reward make it difficult to be solved via standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Prior RL approaches focus only on limited STL fragments or use STL robustness scores as sparse terminal rewards. In this paper, we propose TGPO, Temporal Grounded Policy Optimization, to solve general STL tasks. TGPO decomposes STL into timed subgoals and invariant constraints and provides a hierarchical framework to tackle the problem. The high-level component of TGPO proposes concrete time allocations for these subgoals, and the low-level time-conditioned policy learns to achieve the sequenced subgoals using a dense, stage-wise reward signal. During inference, we sample various time allocations and select the most promising assignment for the policy network to rollout the solution trajectory. To foster efficient policy learning for complex STL with multiple subgoals, we leverage the learned critic to guide the high-level temporal search via Metropolis-Hastings sampling, focusing exploration on temporally feasible solutions. We conduct experiments on five environments, ranging from low-dimensional navigation to manipulation, drone, and quadrupedal locomotion. Under a wide range of STL tasks, TGPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (especially for high-dimensional and long-horizon cases), with an average of 31.6% improvement in task success rate compared to the best baseline.

Despite these benefits, we identify two key inefficiencies in existing LoRA fine-tuning systems. First, they incur substantial runtime overhead due to redundant memory accesses on large activation tensors. Second, they miss the opportunity to concurrently fine-tune multiple independent LoRA adapters that share the same base model on the same set of GPUs. This leads to missed performance gains such as reduced pipeline bubbles, better communication overlap, and improved GPU load balance. To address these issues, we introduce LoRAFusion, an efficient LoRA fine-tuning system for LLMs. At the kernel level, we propose a graph-splitting method that fuses memory-bound operations. This design eliminates unnecessary memory accesses and preserves the performance of compute-bound GEMMs without incurring the cost of recomputation or synchronization. At the scheduling level, LoRAFusion introduces an adaptive batching algorithm for multi-job fine-tuning. It first splits LoRA adapters into groups to intentionally stagger batch execution across jobs, and then solves a bin-packing problem within each group to generate balanced, dependency-aware microbatches. LoRAFusion achieves up to $1.96\times$ ($1.47\times$ on average) end-to-end speedup compared to Megatron-LM, and up to $1.46\times$ ($1.29\times$ on average) improvement over mLoRA, the state-of-the-art multi-LoRA fine-tuning system. Our fused kernel achieves up to $1.39\times$ ($1.27\times$ on average) kernel performance improvement and can directly serve as a plug-and-play replacement in existing LoRA systems.

Each task is grounded in realistic user personas and enterprise context, spanning a heterogeneous search space that includes productivity software, cloud file systems, emails, chat conversations, and the open web. Tasks are generated through a carefully designed synthesis pipeline with human-in-the-loop verification, and agents are evaluated on their ability to recall relevant insights, maintain factual accuracy, and produce coherent, well-structured reports. We release 15 deep research tasks across 10 domains, such as Sales, Cybersecurity, and Compliance.

The recent integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has further enhanced prediction accuracy in contemporary social recommendation algorithms. However, many GNN-based approaches in social recommendation lack the ability to furnish meaningful explanations for their predictions. In this study, we confront this challenge by introducing SoREX, a self-explanatory GNN-based social recommendation framework. SoREX adopts a two-tower framework enhanced by friend recommendation, independently modeling social relations and user-item interactions, while jointly optimizing an auxiliary task to reinforce social signals. To offer explanations, we propose a novel ego-path extraction approach. This method involves transforming the ego-net of a target user into a collection of multi-hop ego-paths, from which we extract factor-specific and candidate-aware ego-path subsets as explanations. This process facilitates the summarization of detailed comparative explanations among different candidate items through intricate substructure analysis. Furthermore, we conduct explanation re-aggregation to explicitly correlate explanations with downstream predictions, imbuing our framework with inherent self-explainability. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four widely adopted benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of SoREX in predictive accuracy. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative analyses confirm the efficacy of the extracted explanations in SoREX. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/antman9914/SoREX.<br>

However, evaluating their capacity for human-like understanding in One-Image Guides remains insufficiently explored. One-Image Guides are a visual format combining text, imagery, and symbols to present reorganized and structured information for easier comprehension, which are specifically designed for human viewing and inherently embody the characteristics of human perception and understanding. Here, we present OIG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark focused on One-Image Guide understanding across diverse domains. To reduce the cost of manual annotation, we developed a semi-automated annotation pipeline in which multiple intelligent agents collaborate to generate preliminary image descriptions, assisting humans in constructing image-text pairs. With OIG-Bench, we have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of 29 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both proprietary and open-source models. The results show that Qwen2.5-VL-72B performs the best among the evaluated models, with an overall accuracy of 77%. Nevertheless, all models exhibit notable weaknesses in semantic understanding and logical reasoning, indicating that current MLLMs still struggle to accurately interpret complex visual-text relationships. In addition, we also demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent annotation system outperforms all MLLMs in image captioning, highlighting its potential as both a high-quality image description generator and a valuable tool for future dataset construction.

However, their performance on high-resolution images remains suboptimal. While existing approaches often attribute this limitation to perceptual constraints and argue that MLLMs struggle to recognize small objects, leading them to use "zoom in" strategies for better detail, our analysis reveals a different cause: the main issue is not object size, but rather caused by complex background interference. We systematically analyze this "zoom in" operation through a series of decoupling experiments and propose the Hierarchical Decoupling Framework (HiDe), a training-free framework that uses Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD) to decouple the question tokens and identify the key information tokens, then leverages their attention weights to achieve precise alignment with the target visual regions. Subsequently, it employs Layout-Preserving Decoupling (LPD) to decouple these regions from the background and reconstructs a compact representation that preserves essential spatial layouts while eliminating background interference. HiDe sets a new SOTA on V*Bench, HRBench4K, and HRBench8K, boosting Qwen2.5-VL 7B and InternVL3 8B to SOTA (92.1% and 91.6% on V*Bench), even surpassing RL methods.

However, PK data are often embedded in complex, heterogeneous tables with variable structures and inconsistent terminologies, posing significant challenges for automated PK data retrieval and standardization. AutoPK, a novel two-stage framework for accurate and scalable extraction of PK data from complex scientific tables. In the first stage, AutoPK identifies and extracts PK parameter variants using large language models (LLMs), a hybrid similarity metric, and LLM-based validation. The second stage filters relevant rows, converts the table into a key-value text format, and uses an LLM to reconstruct a standardized table. Evaluated on a real-world dataset of 605 PK tables, including captions and footnotes, AutoPK shows significant improvements in precision and recall over direct LLM baselines. For instance, AutoPK with LLaMA 3.1-70B achieved an F1-score of 0.92 on half-life and 0.91 on clearance parameters, outperforming direct use of LLaMA 3.1-70B by margins of 0.10 and 0.21, respectively. Smaller models such as Gemma 3-27B and Phi 3-12B with AutoPK achieved 2-7 fold F1 gains over their direct use, with Gemma's hallucination rates reduced from 60-95% down to 8-14%. Notably, AutoPK enabled open-source models like Gemma 3-27B to outperform commercial systems such as GPT-4o Mini on several PK parameters. AutoPK enables scalable and high-confidence PK data extraction, making it well-suited for critical applications in veterinary pharmacology, drug safety monitoring, and public health decision-making, while addressing heterogeneous table structures and terminology and demonstrating generalizability across key PK parameters.

However, they still struggle to effectively understand and follow long and detailed prompts, displaying inconsistent generation. To address this challenge, we introduce LPG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating long-prompt-based text-to-image generation. LPG-Bench features 200 meticulously crafted prompts with an average length of over 250 words, approaching the input capacity of several leading commercial models. Using these prompts, we generate 2,600 images from 13 state-of-the-art models and further perform comprehensive human-ranked annotations. Based on LPG-Bench, we observe that state-of-the-art T2I alignment evaluation metrics exhibit poor consistency with human preferences on long-prompt-based image generation. To address the gap, we introduce a novel zero-shot metric based on text-to-image-to-text consistency, termed TIT, for evaluating long-prompt-generated images. The core concept of TIT is to quantify T2I alignment by directly comparing the consistency between the raw prompt and the LMM-produced description on the generated image, which includes an efficient score-based instantiation TIT-Score and a large-language-model (LLM) based instantiation TIT-Score-LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves superior alignment with human judgment compared to CLIP-score, LMM-score, etc., with TIT-Score-LLM attaining a 7.31% absolute improvement in pairwise accuracy over the strongest baseline. LPG-Bench and TIT methods together offer a deeper perspective to benchmark and foster the development of T2I models. All resources will be made publicly available.<br>

By leveraging blockchain and artificial intelligence technologies, Web 3.0 offers unprecedented opportunities for users to create, own, and monetize their content, thereby enabling User-Generated Content (UGC) to an entirely new level. However, some self-interested users may exploit the limitations of content curation mechanisms and generate low-quality content with less effort, obtaining platform rewards under information asymmetry. Such behavior can undermine Web 3.0 performance. To this end, we propose \textit{LMM-Incentive}, a novel Large Multimodal Model (LMM)-based incentive mechanism for UGC in Web 3.0. Specifically, we propose an LMM-based contract-theoretic model to motivate users to generate high-quality UGC, thereby mitigating the adverse selection problem from information asymmetry. To alleviate potential moral hazards after contract selection, we leverage LMM agents to evaluate UGC quality, which is the primary component of the contract, utilizing prompt engineering techniques to improve the evaluation performance of LMM agents. Recognizing that traditional contract design methods cannot effectively adapt to the dynamic environment of Web 3.0, we develop an improved Mixture of Experts (MoE)-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for optimal contract design. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MoE-based PPO algorithm over representative benchmarks in the context of contract design. Finally, we deploy the designed contract within an Ethereum smart contract framework, further validating the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.<br>

However, it has traditionally relied on human subjective ratings such as the Mean Opinion Score (MOS), which depend on manual annotations and often suffer from inconsistent rating standards and poor reproducibility. To address these limitations, we introduce MOS-RMBench, a unified benchmark that reformulates diverse MOS datasets into a preference-comparison setting, enabling rigorous evaluation across different datasets. Building on MOS-RMBench, we systematically construct and evaluate three paradigms for reward modeling: scalar reward models, semi-scalar reward models, and generative reward models (GRMs). Our experiments reveal three key findings: (1) scalar models achieve the strongest overall performance, consistently exceeding 74% accuracy; (2) most models perform considerably worse on synthetic speech than on human speech; and (3) all models struggle on pairs with very small MOS differences. To improve performance on these challenging pairs, we propose a MOS-aware GRM that incorporates an MOS-difference-based reward function, enabling the model to adaptively scale rewards according to the difficulty of each sample pair. Experimental results show that the MOS-aware GRM significantly improves fine-grained quality discrimination and narrows the gap with scalar models on the most challenging cases. We hope this work will establish both a benchmark and a methodological framework to foster more rigorous and scalable research in automatic speech quality assessment.<br>

While methods exist for each issue, effectively combining them is non-trivial, as distinguishing genuine tail samples from noisy data proves difficult, often leading to conflicting optimization strategies. This paper presents a novel perspective: instead of primarily developing new complex techniques from scratch, we explore synergistically leveraging well-established, individually 'weak' auxiliary models - specialized for tackling either class imbalance or label noise but not both. This view is motivated by the insight that class imbalance (a distributional-level concern) and label noise (a sample-level concern) operate at different granularities, suggesting that robustness mechanisms for each can in principle offer complementary strengths without conflict. We propose Dual-granularity Sinkhorn Distillation (D-SINK), a novel framework that enhances dual robustness by distilling and integrating complementary insights from such 'weak', single-purpose auxiliary models. Specifically, D-SINK uses an optimal transport-optimized surrogate label allocation to align the target model's sample-level predictions with a noise-robust auxiliary and its class distributions with an imbalance-robust one. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that D-SINK significantly improves robustness and achieves strong empirical performance in learning from long-tailed noisy data.<br>

A high-precision dynamic digital human avatar can be applied to various fields such as game production, animation generation, and remote immersive communication. However, these 4D human avatar meshes are prone to being degraded by various types of noise during the processes of collection, compression, and transmission, thereby affecting the viewing experience of users. In light of this fact, quality assessment of dynamic 4D digital humans becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we first propose a large-scale dynamic digital human quality assessment dataset, DHQA-4D, which contains 32 high-quality real-scanned 4D human mesh sequences, 1920 distorted textured 4D human meshes degraded by 11 textured distortions, as well as their corresponding textured and non-textured mean opinion scores (MOSs). Equipped with DHQA-4D dataset, we analyze the influence of different types of distortion on human perception for textured dynamic 4D meshes and non-textured dynamic 4D meshes. Additionally, we propose DynaMesh-Rater, a novel large multimodal model (LMM) based approach that is able to assess both textured 4D meshes and non-textured 4D meshes. Concretely, DynaMesh-Rater elaborately extracts multi-dimensional features, including visual features from a projected 2D video, motion features from cropped video clips, and geometry features from the 4D human mesh to provide comprehensive quality-related information. Then we utilize a LMM model to integrate the multi-dimensional features and conduct a LoRA-based instruction tuning technique to teach the LMM model to predict the quality scores. Extensive experimental results on the DHQA-4D dataset demonstrate the superiority of our DynaMesh-Rater method over previous quality assessment methods.<br>

However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition. Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data, RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.<br>

However, current LRMs exhibit two critical limitations when processing non-English languages: (1) They often struggle to maintain input-output language consistency; (2) They generally perform poorly with wrong reasoning paths and lower answer accuracy compared to English. These limitations significantly degrade the user experience for non-English speakers and hinder the global deployment of LRMs. To address these limitations, we propose M-Thinker, which is trained by the GRPO algorithm that involves a Language Consistency (LC) reward and a novel Cross-lingual Thinking Alignment (CTA) reward. Specifically, the LC reward defines a strict constraint on the language consistency between the input, thought, and answer. Besides, the CTA reward compares the model's non-English reasoning paths with its English reasoning path to transfer its own reasoning capability from English to non-English languages. Through an iterative RL procedure, our M-Thinker-1.5B/7B models not only achieve nearly 100% language consistency and superior performance on two multilingual benchmarks (MMATH and PolyMath), but also exhibit excellent generalization on out-of-domain languages.<br>

However, this approach introduces significant computational inefficiency due to inter-trace redundancy -- our analysis reveals that over 80% of parallel reasoning traces yield identical final answers, representing substantial wasted computation. To address this critical efficiency bottleneck, we propose DeepPrune, a novel framework that enables efficient parallel scaling through dynamic pruning. Our method features a specialized judge model trained with focal loss and oversampling techniques to accurately predict answer equivalence from partial reasoning traces which realizes 0.87 AUROC on equivalence prediction, combined with an online greedy clustering algorithm that dynamically prunes redundant paths while preserving answer diversity. Comprehensive evaluations across three challenging benchmarks (AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and GPQA) and multiple reasoning models demonstrate that DeepPrune achieves remarkable token reduction by over 80% compared to conventional consensus sampling on most cases, while maintaining competitive accuracy within 3 percentage points.

While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains such as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain remains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and high-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test static knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing the dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce StockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in realistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market signals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential buy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics such as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and open-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM agents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models demonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more effectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in developing LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static financial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful trading strategies. We release StockBench as an open-source resource to support reproducibility and advance future research in this domain.<br>

Recent research has witnessed a transition from reinforcement learning (RL)-free to RL-based methods. Current RL-based methods either rely on dense external reward signals or extract intrinsic reward signals from LLMs themselves. However, these approaches diverge from the self-evolution mechanisms observed in human intelligence, where individuals learn and improve through mutual discussion and collaboration. In this work, we introduce Co-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems (CoMAS), a novel framework that enables agents to improve autonomously by learning from inter-agent interactions without external supervision. CoMAS generates intrinsic rewards from rich discussion dynamics, employs an LLM-as-a-judge mechanism to formulate these rewards, and optimizes each agent's policy through RL, thereby enabling decentralized and scalable co-evolution. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMAS consistently outperforms untrained agents and achieves state-of-the-art performance across most evaluation settings. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of interaction-based reward signals and reveal promising scalability as the number and diversity of agents increase. These findings establish CoMAS as a novel and effective paradigm for self-evolution in LLM-based agents.<br>

Our implementation encompasses the full reinforcement learning framework, including reward and cost accounting, as well as the deployment and evaluation pipelines. Across diverse benchmarks, xRouter achieves strong cost-performance trade-offs (e.g., substantial cost reductions at comparable task completion rates), and provides empirical insights into what reliably helps learned routing and what does not, ranging from model trainability to the difficulty of eliciting sophisticated orchestration behaviors in small open models.

The widespread adoption of this tool-augmented reasoning is hindered by the scarcity of domain-specific tools. For instance, in domains such as physics question answering, suitable and specialized tools are often missing. Recent work has explored automating tool creation by extracting reusable functions from Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning traces; however, these approaches face a critical scalability bottleneck. As the number of generated tools grows, storing them in an unstructured collection leads to significant retrieval challenges, including an expanding search space and ambiguity between function-related tools. To address this, we propose a systematic approach to automatically refactor an unstructured collection of tools into a structured tool library. Our system first generates discrete, task-specific tools and clusters them into semantically coherent topics. Within each cluster, we introduce a multi-agent framework to consolidate scattered functionalities: a code agent refactors code to extract shared logic and creates versatile, aggregated tools, while a reviewing agent ensures that these aggregated tools maintain the complete functional capabilities of the original set. This process transforms numerous question-specific tools into a smaller set of powerful, aggregated tools without loss of functionality. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves tool retrieval accuracy and overall reasoning performance across multiple reasoning tasks. Furthermore, our method shows enhanced scalability compared with baselines as the number of question-specific increases.<br>

To address this, we introduce the Webscale-RL pipeline, a scalable data engine that systematically converts large-scale pre-training documents into millions of diverse, verifiable question-answer pairs for RL. Using this pipeline, we construct the Webscale-RL dataset, containing 1.2 million examples across more than 9 domains. Our experiments show that the model trained on this dataset significantly outperforms continual pretraining and strong data refinement baselines across a suite of benchmarks. Notably, RL training with our dataset proves substantially more efficient, achieving the performance of continual pre-training with up to 100$\times$ fewer tokens. Our work presents a viable path toward scaling RL to pre-training levels, enabling more capable and efficient language models.<br>

It shows that cross-entropy loss decreases in a predictable power-law rate as the model size increases. However, recent evidence indicates that this law breaks down at very large scales: the loss decreases more slowly than expected, which causes significant trouble for developing large language models. In this paper, we hypothesize that the root cause lies in the fact that cross-entropy itself does not truly scale; instead, only one of its hidden components does. To investigate this, we introduce a novel decomposition of cross-entropy into three parts: Error-Entropy, Self-Alignment, and Confidence. We show both theoretically and empirically that this decomposition precisely captures the training dynamics and optimization objectives. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and 32 models spanning five orders of magnitude in size, we find that only error-entropy follows a robust power-law scaling, while the other two terms remain largely invariant. Moreover, error-entropy constitutes the dominant share of cross-entropy in small models but diminishes in proportion as models grow larger. This explains why the cross-entropy scaling law appears accurate at small scales but fails at very large ones. Our findings establish the error-entropy scaling law as a more accurate description of model behavior. We believe it will have wide applications in the training, understanding, and future development of large language models.<br>

Humans, by contrast, exploit website-provided functionality through high-level operations like search, filter, and sort. We introduce WALT (Web Agents that Learn Tools), a framework that reverse-engineers latent website functionality into reusable invocable tools. Rather than hypothesizing ad-hoc skills, WALT exposes robust implementations of automations already designed into websites -- spanning discovery (search, filter, sort), communication (post, comment, upvote), and content management (create, edit, delete). Tools abstract away low-level execution: instead of reasoning about how to click and type, agents simply call search(query) or create(listing). This shifts the computational burden from fragile step-by-step reasoning to reliable tool invocation. On VisualWebArena and WebArena, WALT achieves higher success with fewer steps and less LLM-dependent reasoning, establishing a robust and generalizable paradigm for browser automation.<br>

Unlike static AI models, self-evolving agents embed an autonomous evolution cycle that updates models, tools, and workflows in response to environmental dynamics. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of self-evolving agentic AI, highlighting its layered architecture, life cycle, and key techniques, including tool intelligence, workflow optimization, self-reflection, and evolutionary learning. We further propose a multi-agent cooperative self-evolving agentic AI framework, where multiple large language models (LLMs) are assigned role-specialized prompts under the coordination of a supervisor agent. Through structured dialogue, iterative feedback, and systematic validation, the system autonomously executes the entire life cycle without human intervention. A case study on antenna evolution in low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) demonstrates how the framework autonomously upgrades fixed antenna optimization into movable antenna optimization. Experimental results show that the proposed self-evolving agentic AI autonomously improves beam gain and restores degraded performance by up to 52.02%, consistently surpassing the fixed baseline with little to no human intervention and validating its adaptability and robustness for next-generation wireless intelligence.<br>

To achieve this, substantial human demonstrations need to be collected to cover different spatial configurations for training a generalized visuomotor policy via imitation learning. Prior works explore a promising direction that leverages data generation to acquire abundant spatially diverse data from minimal source demonstrations. However, most approaches face significant sim-to-real gap and are often limited to constrained settings, such as fixed-base scenarios and predefined camera viewpoints. In this paper, we propose a real-to-real 3D data generation framework (R2RGen) that directly augments the pointcloud observation-action pairs to generate real-world data. R2RGen is simulator- and rendering-free, thus being efficient and plug-and-play. Specifically, given a single source demonstration, we introduce an annotation mechanism for fine-grained parsing of scene and trajectory. A group-wise augmentation strategy is proposed to handle complex multi-object compositions and diverse task constraints. We further present camera-aware processing to align the distribution of generated data with real-world 3D sensor. Empirically, R2RGen substantially enhances data efficiency on extensive experiments and demonstrates strong potential for scaling and application on mobile manipulation.<br>

Knowledge distillation (KD) can transfer capabilities from large teacher models, but existing methods involve trade-offs: off-policy distillation provides high-quality supervision but introduces a training-inference mismatch, while on-policy approaches maintain consistency but rely on low-quality student outputs. To address these issues, we propose AdaSwitch, a novel approach that dynamically combines on-policy and off-policy generation at the token level. AdaSwitch allows the student to first explore its own predictions and then selectively integrate teacher guidance based on real-time quality assessment. This approach simultaneously preserves consistency and maintains supervision quality. Experiments on three datasets with two teacher-student LLM pairs demonstrate that AdaSwitch consistently improves accuracy, offering a practical and effective method for distilling SLMs with acceptable additional overhead.<br>

Aligning these agents via preference-based offline methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a promising direction, yet it faces a critical granularity mismatch. Trajectory-level DPO provides a signal that is too coarse for precise credit assignment, while step-level DPO is often too myopic to capture the value of multi-step behaviors. To resolve this challenge, we introduce Hierarchical Preference Learning (HPL), a hierarchical framework that optimizes LLM agents by leveraging preference signals at multiple, synergistic granularities. While HPL incorporates trajectory- and step-level DPO for global and local policy stability, its core innovation lies in group-level preference optimization guided by a dual-layer curriculum. Our approach first decomposes expert trajectories into semantically coherent action groups and then generates contrasting suboptimal groups to enable preference learning at a fine-grained, sub-task level. Then, instead of treating all preference pairs equally, HPL introduces a curriculum scheduler that organizes the learning process from simple to complex. This curriculum is structured along two axes: the group length, representing sub-task complexity, and the sample difficulty, defined by the reward gap between preferred and dispreferred action groups. Experiments on three challenging agent benchmarks show that HPL outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our analyses demonstrate that the hierarchical DPO loss effectively integrates preference signals across multiple granularities, while the dual-layer curriculum is crucial for enabling the agent to solve a wide range of tasks, from simple behaviors to complex multi-step sequences.<br>

However, existing methods often fail to adequately account for variations in prompt difficulty or rely on simplistic filtering mechanisms to select prompt datasets within a narrow criterion range, resulting in significant computational waste. In this work, we approach the problem from the perspective of reinforcement learning gradient optimization, offering a systematic and theoretical investigation into how to improve the training efficiency of LLMs. We identify two key factors influencing training efficiency: the selection of training prompts and the allocation of rollout quantities across different prompts. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the sampling distribution of prompts dictates the convergence rate of gradient descent, while the allocation of the rollout quantity influences the consistency and stability of overall gradient updates. Based on these insights, we propose CurES, an efficient training method that accelerates convergence and employs Bayesian posterior estimation to minimize computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that our CurES outperforms Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by \textbf{+3.30} points and \textbf{+4.82} points with 1.5B and 7B models, respectively. Additionally, CurES exhibits faster convergence compared to baselines, including GRPO.<br>

We further design an elegant yet effective dynamic context management strategy for both training and inference, utilizing sliding window mechanisms while eliminating the dependency on external summarization models, thereby efficiently empowering the model to handle continuously expanding long-horizon contexts. Through reinforcement learning on Qwen3-32B, we develop DeepMiner-32B, which achieves substantial performance improvements across multiple search agent benchmarks.

To address this challenge, we leverage implicit rewards, which approximate explicit rewards through log-likelihood ratios, and reveal their structural equivalence with Contrastive Decoding (CD), a decoding strategy shown to reduce noise in LLM generation. Building on this connection, we propose Contrastive Weak-to-Strong Generalization (ConG), a framework that employs contrastive decoding between pre- and post-alignment weak models to generate higher-quality samples. This approach enables more reliable capability transfer, denoising, and improved robustness, substantially mitigating the limitations of traditional weak-to-strong methods.

To investigate this gap, we present EgoNight, the first comprehensive benchmark for nighttime egocentric vision, with visual question answering (VQA) as the core task. A key feature of EgoNight is the introduction of day-night aligned videos, which enhance night annotation quality using the daytime data and reveal clear performance gaps between lighting conditions. To achieve this, we collect both synthetic videos rendered by Blender and real-world recordings, ensuring that scenes and actions are visually and temporally aligned. Leveraging these paired videos, we construct EgoNight-VQA, supported by a novel day-augmented night auto-labeling engine and refinement through extensive human verification. Each QA pair is double-checked by annotators for reliability. In total, EgoNight-VQA contains 3658 QA pairs across 90 videos, spanning 12 diverse QA types, with more than 300 hours of human work. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) reveal substantial performance drops when transferring from day to night, underscoring the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions. Beyond VQA, EgoNight also introduces two auxiliary tasks, day-night correspondence retrieval and egocentric depth estimation at night, that further explore the boundaries of existing models. We believe EgoNight-VQA provides a strong foundation for advancing application-driven egocentric vision research and for developing models that generalize across illumination domains.

To alleviate these concerns, we propose and study the problem of Relational Database Distillation (RDD). Specifically, we aim to distill large-scale RDBs into compact heterogeneous graphs while retaining the predictive power (i.e., utility) required for training graph-based models. Multi-modal column information is preserved through node features, and primary-foreign key relations are encoded via heterogeneous edges, thereby maintaining both data fidelity and relational structure. To ensure adaptability across diverse downstream tasks without engaging the traditional, inefficient bi-level distillation framework, we further design a kernel ridge regression-guided objective with pseudo-labels, which produces quality features for the distilled graph. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world RDBs demonstrate that our solution substantially reduces the data size while maintaining competitive performance on classification and regression tasks, creating an effective pathway for scalable learning with RDBs.<br>

However, these models are highly vulnerable to adversarial prompts, which can bypass safety measures and produce harmful content. Despite various defensive strategies, achieving robustness against attacks while maintaining practical utility in real-world applications remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we first conduct an empirical study of the text encoder in the Stable Diffusion (SD) model, which is a widely used and representative text-to-image model. Our findings reveal that the [EOS] token acts as a semantic aggregator, exhibiting distinct distributional patterns between benign and adversarial prompts in its embedding space. Building on this insight, we introduce \textbf{SafeGuider}, a two-step framework designed for robust safety control without compromising generation quality. SafeGuider combines an embedding-level recognition model with a safety-aware feature erasure beam search algorithm. This integration enables the framework to maintain high-quality image generation for benign prompts while ensuring robust defense against both in-domain and out-of-domain attacks. SafeGuider demonstrates exceptional effectiveness in minimizing attack success rates, achieving a maximum rate of only 5.48\% across various attack scenarios. Moreover, instead of refusing to generate or producing black images for unsafe prompts, \textbf{SafeGuider} generates safe and meaningful images, enhancing its practical utility. In addition, SafeGuider is not limited to the SD model and can be effectively applied to other text-to-image models, such as the Flux model, demonstrating its versatility and adaptability across different architectures. We hope that SafeGuider can shed some light on the practical deployment of secure text-to-image systems.<br>

However, previous audio hiding methods often result in unsatisfactory quality when recovering secret audio, due to their inherent limitations in the modeling of time-frequency relationships. In this paper, we explore these limitations and introduce a new DNN-based approach. We use a flow-based invertible neural network to establish a direct link between stego audio, cover audio, and secret audio, enhancing the reversibility of embedding and extracting messages. To address common issues from time-frequency transformations that degrade secret audio quality during recovery, we implement a time-frequency loss on the time-domain signal. This approach not only retains the benefits of time-frequency constraints but also enhances the reversibility of message recovery, which is vital for practical applications. We also add an encryption technique to protect the hidden data from unauthorized access. Experimental results on the VCTK and LibriSpeech datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms previous approaches in terms of subjective and objective metrics and exhibits robustness to various types of noise, suggesting its utility in targeted secure communication scenarios.<br>

While current approaches based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs, e.g., CLIP) and more recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs, e.g., Qwen-VL) have shown progress, they predominantly function as ``black boxes." This inherent opacity not only prevents users from understanding the retrieval rationale but also restricts the models' ability to follow complex, fine-grained instructions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce CIR-CoT, the first end-to-end retrieval-oriented MLLM designed to integrate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. By compelling the model to first generate an interpretable reasoning chain, CIR-CoT enhances its ability to capture crucial cross-modal interactions, leading to more accurate retrieval while making its decision process transparent. Since existing datasets like FashionIQ and CIRR lack the necessary reasoning data, a key contribution of our work is the creation of structured CoT annotations using a three-stage process involving a caption, reasoning, and conclusion. Our model is then fine-tuned to produce this structured output before encoding its final retrieval intent into a dedicated embedding. Comprehensive experiments show that CIR-CoT achieves highly competitive performance on in-domain datasets (FashionIQ, CIRR) and demonstrates remarkable generalization on the out-of-domain CIRCO dataset, establishing a new path toward more effective and trustworthy retrieval systems.<br>

However, this broad-view approach often lacks the deep structured reasoning needed for complex multi-hop question answering (QA), leading to incomplete evidence and error accumulation. To address these limitations, we propose SubQRAG, a sub-question-driven framework that enhances reasoning depth. SubQRAG decomposes a complex question into an ordered chain of verifiable sub-questions. For each sub-question, it retrieves relevant triples from the graph. When the existing graph is insufficient, the system dynamically expands it by extracting new triples from source documents in real time. All triples used in the reasoning process are aggregated into a "graph memory," forming a structured and traceable evidence path for final answer generation. Experiments on three multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that SubQRAG achieves consistent and significant improvements, especially in Exact Match scores.<br>

This prevents the model from interacting during the user's turn and can lead to high response latency while it waits to think. Consequently, thinking after receiving the full input is not suitable for speech-to-speech interaction, where real-time, low-latency exchange is important. We address this by noting that humans naturally "think while listening." In this paper, we propose SHANKS, a general inference framework that enables SLMs to generate unspoken chain-of-thought reasoning while listening to the user input. SHANKS streams the input speech in fixed-duration chunks and, as soon as a chunk is received, generates unspoken reasoning based on all previous speech and reasoning, while the user continues speaking. SHANKS uses this unspoken reasoning to decide whether to interrupt the user and to make tool calls to complete the task. We demonstrate that SHANKS enhances real-time user-SLM interaction in two scenarios: (1) when the user is presenting a step-by-step solution to a math problem, SHANKS can listen, reason, and interrupt when the user makes a mistake, achieving 37.1% higher interruption accuracy than a baseline that interrupts without thinking; and (2) in a tool-augmented dialogue, SHANKS can complete 56.9% of the tool calls before the user finishes their turn. Overall, SHANKS moves toward models that keep thinking throughout the conversation, not only after a turn ends. Animated illustrations of Shanks can be found at https://d223302.github.io/SHANKS/<br>

Building upon the foundations of diffusion models, the simulation-free paradigm of FM enables simple and efficient training, but inherently introduces a train-inference gap. Specifically, we cannot assess the model's output during the training phase. In contrast, other generative models including Variational Autoencoder (VAE), Normalizing Flow and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) directly optimize on the reconstruction loss. Such a gap is particularly evident in scenarios that demand high precision, such as robotic manipulation. Moreover, we show that FM's over-pursuit of straight predefined paths may introduce some serious problems such as stiffness into the system. These motivate us to fine-tune FM via Maximum Likelihood Estimation of reconstructions - an approach made feasible by FM's underlying smooth ODE formulation, in contrast to the stochastic differential equations (SDEs) used in diffusion models. This paper first theoretically analyzes the relation between training loss and inference error in FM. Then we propose a method of fine-tuning FM via Maximum Likelihood Estimation of reconstructions, which includes both straightforward fine-tuning and residual-based fine-tuning approaches. Furthermore, through specifically designed architectures, the residual-based fine-tuning can incorporate the contraction property into the model, which is crucial for the model's robustness and interpretability. Experimental results in image generation and robotic manipulation verify that our method reliably improves the inference performance of FM.<br>

In this work, we first conduct an extensive empirical investigation to evaluate this capability. Leveraging a carefully designed data synthesis engine, we construct MM-HELIX, a multimodal benchmark consisting 1,260 samples of 42 challenging synthetic tasks that require iterative thinking and backtracking. Empirical results on this benchmark reveal that existing MLLMs exhibit significant performance deficits in long-chain reflective reasoning. To address this limitation, we generate post-training data and further explore learning paradigms for exploiting such data. We first develop the Step-Elicited Response Generation pipeline to create MM-HELIX-100K, a large-scale dataset of 100k high-quality, reflective reasoning traces for instruction-tuning stage. Given that standard Reinforcement Learning fails on complex tasks due to sparse reward signals and catastrophic forgetting after Supervised Fine-Tuning, we propose Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization (AHPO), a novel training strategy that dynamically unifies offline supervision and online optimization into a single stage. This strategy enables the model to learn from expert data when rewards are sparse and conduct independent exploration once proficient. When applied to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline, our method achieves a +18.6\% accuracy improvement on MM-HELIX benchmark and demonstrates strong generalization with a +5.7\% average performance gain on general mathematic and logic tasks.

First, most benchmarks leak the reasoning path in the question text, allowing models to follow surface cues rather than discover reasoning chains autonomously. Second, evaluation is typically reduced to a single pass rate, which collapses diverse behaviours into one score and obscures whether failures stem from inadequate search, poor knowledge use, or inappropriate refusal. To address these issues, we present WebDetective, a benchmark of hint-free multi-hop questions paired with a controlled Wikipedia sandbox that ensures full traceability of model actions, and a holistic evaluation framework that separates search sufficiency, knowledge utilisation, and refusal behaviour. Our evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art models reveals systematic weaknesses across all architectures: models struggle with knowledge utilisation despite having sufficient evidence and demonstrate near-absent appropriate refusal when evidence is lacking. These patterns expose a fundamental gap: today's systems excel at executing given reasoning paths but fail when required to discover them. We develop an agentic workflow, EvidenceLoop, that explicitly targets the challenges our benchmark identifies, incorporating verification loops and systematic evidence tracking that improve both search and synthesis capabilities. This baseline demonstrates that WebDetective's diagnostic framework can guide concrete architectural improvements, establishing our benchmark as a critical tool for developing genuinely autonomous reasoning systems rather than pattern-following agents.<br>

However, existing methods often fail to achieve this balance, yielding representations that are either overly redundant or lacking in task-critical information. We propose an unsupervised approach that learns a highly compressed two-token state representation using a lightweight encoder and a pre-trained Diffusion Transformer (DiT) decoder, capitalizing on its strong generative prior. Our representation is efficient, interpretable, and integrates seamlessly into existing VLA-based models, improving performance by 14.3% on LIBERO and 30% in real-world task success with minimal inference overhead. More importantly, we find that the difference between these tokens, obtained via latent interpolation, naturally serves as a highly effective latent action, which can be further decoded into executable robot actions. This emergent capability reveals that our representation captures structured dynamics without explicit supervision. We name our method StaMo for its ability to learn generalizable robotic Motion from compact State representation, which is encoded from static images, challenging the prevalent dependence to learning latent action on complex architectures and video data. The resulting latent actions also enhance policy co-training, outperforming prior methods by 10.4% with improved interpretability. Moreover, our approach scales effectively across diverse data sources, including real-world robot data, simulation, and human egocentric video.<br>

Conventional Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which integrate reasoning and action into a monolithic architecture, generalize poorly because they are constrained by scarce, narrow-domain data. While recent dual-system approaches attempt to decouple "thinking" from "acting", they are often constrained by semantic ambiguities within the action module. This ambiguity makes large-scale, cross-task training infeasible. Consequently, these systems typically necessitate fine-tuning on newly collected data when deployed to novel environments, and the cooperation mechanism between the two systems remains ill-defined. To address these limitations, we introduce, for the first time, a framework centered around a generalizable action expert. Our approach utilizes sparse 3D trajectories as an intermediate representation, effectively bridging the high-level planning capabilities of the VLM with the low-level physical action module. During the planning phase, the VLM is only required to generate coarse 3D waypoints. These waypoints are then processed by our generalizable action expert, which refines them into dense, executable action sequences by sampling real-time point cloud observations of the environment. To promote training efficiency and robust generalization, we introduce a novel "Action Pre-training, Pointcloud Fine-tuning" paradigm. Our method combines the broad generalization capabilities of VLMs in visual understanding and planning with the fine-grained, action-level generalization of action expert.<br>

This issue stems from their overreliance on continuous action sequences or action chunks, which inadvertently create isolated data silos that disrupt knowledge retention across tasks. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Narrowing of Trajectory VLA (NoTVLA) framework: a novel approach that narrows its focus to sparse trajectories, thereby avoiding the catastrophic forgetting associated with dense trajectory fine-tuning. A key innovation of NoTVLA lies in its trajectory planning strategy: instead of centering on the target object's trajectory, it leverages temporal compression and spatial reasoning pruning specifically for the robot end effector's trajectory. Furthermore, training is conducted using these sparse trajectories rather than dense action trajectories, an optimization that delivers remarkable practical advantages with better performance in zero-shot. In multi-task evaluation scenarios, NoTVLA achieves superior performance and generalization compared to pi0 while operating under two critical constraints: it uses over an order of magnitude less computing power than pi0 and requires no wrist-mounted camera. This design ensures that NoTVLA's operational accuracy closely approximates that of single-task expert models. Crucially, it also preserves the model's inherent language capabilities, enabling zero-shot generalization in specific scenarios, supporting unified model deployment across multiple robot platforms, and fostering a degree of generalization even when perceiving tasks from novel perspectives.<br>

Previous methods either rely on text-level information (e.g., reward models, majority voting), which can overfit to superficial cues, or on calibrated confidence from token probabilities, which would fail on less-calibrated models. Yet both of these signals are, in fact, partial projections of a richer source of information: the model's internal hidden states. Early layers, closer to token embeddings, preserve semantic and lexical features that underpin text-based judgments, while later layers increasingly align with output logits, embedding confidence-related information. This paper explores hidden states directly as a unified foundation for verification. We show that the correctness of a solution is encoded as a geometrically separable signature within the trajectory of hidden activations. To validate this, we present Clue (Clustering and Experience-based Verification), a deliberately minimalist, non-parametric verifier. With no trainable parameters, CLUE only summarizes each reasoning trace by an hidden state delta and classifies correctness via nearest-centroid distance to ``success'' and ``failure'' clusters formed from past experience. The simplicity of this method highlights the strength of the underlying signal. Empirically, CLUE consistently outperforms LLM-as-a-judge baselines and matches or exceeds modern confidence-based methods in reranking candidates, improving both top-1 and majority-vote accuracy across AIME 24/25 and GPQA. As a highlight, on AIME 24 with a 1.5B model, CLUE boosts accuracy from 56.7% (majority@64) to 70.0% (top-maj@16).<br>

Current methods treat the visual input as a fixed, deterministic condition, overlooking a critical source of ambiguity and struggling to build policies robust to plausible visual variations. We introduce $\textbf{VOGUE (Visual Uncertainty Guided Exploration)}$, a novel method that shifts exploration from the output (text) to the input (visual) space. By treating the image as a stochastic context, VOGUE quantifies the policy's sensitivity to visual perturbations using the symmetric KL divergence between a "raw" and "noisy" branch, creating a direct signal for uncertainty-aware exploration. This signal shapes the learning objective via an uncertainty-proportional bonus, which, combined with a token-entropy bonus and an annealed sampling schedule, effectively balances exploration and exploitation. Implemented within GRPO on two model scales (Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B), VOGUE boosts pass@1 accuracy by an average of 2.6% on three visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on three general-domain reasoning benchmarks, while simultaneously increasing pass@4 performance and mitigating the exploration decay commonly observed in RL fine-tuning. Our work shows that grounding exploration in the inherent uncertainty of visual inputs is an effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning.<br>

While our prior work has evaluated early-generation AI cell foundation models in this domain, the effectiveness of recent cell foundation models remains unclear. In this study, we benchmark advanced AI cell foundation models (2025), including CellViT++ variants and Cellpose-SAM, against three widely used cell foundation models developed prior to 2024, using a diverse large-scale set of kidney image patches within a human-in-the-loop rating framework. We further performed fusion-based ensemble evaluation and model agreement analysis to assess the segmentation capabilities of the different models. Our results show that CellViT++ [Virchow] yields the highest standalone performance with 40.3% of predictions rated as "Good" on a curated set of 2,091 challenging samples, outperforming all prior models. In addition, our fused model achieves 62.2% "Good" predictions and only 0.4% "Bad", substantially reducing segmentation errors. Notably, the fusion model (2025) successfully resolved the majority of challenging cases that remained unaddressed in our previous study. These findings demonstrate the potential of AI cell foundation model development in renal pathology and provide a curated dataset of challenging samples to support future kidney-specific model refinement.<br>

Rather than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work, we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge, showing powerful transferability and generalization.

Furthermore, these models face challenges in adapting their reasoning capabilities to rapidly changing environments due to the static nature of their pretraining data. To address these issues, advancing Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex reasoning tasks requires innovative approaches that bridge intuitive and deliberate cognitive processes, akin to human cognition's dual-system dynamic. This paper introduces a Multi-Agent System for Deep ReSearch (MARS) enabling seamless integration of System 1's fast, intuitive thinking with System 2's deliberate reasoning within LLMs. MARS strategically integrates multiple external tools, such as Google Search, Google Scholar, and Python Interpreter, to access up-to-date information and execute complex computations, while creating a specialized division of labor where System 1 efficiently processes and summarizes high-volume external information, providing distilled insights that expand System 2's reasoning context without overwhelming its capacity. Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework extending Group Relative Policy Optimization to simultaneously optimize both systems with multi-turn tool interactions, bin-packing optimization, and sample balancing strategies that enhance collaborative efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate MARS achieves substantial improvements of 3.86% on the challenging Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) benchmark and an average gain of 8.9% across 7 knowledge-intensive tasks, validating the effectiveness of our dual-system paradigm for complex reasoning in dynamic information environments.<br>

To address this, we propose Video-STAR, a framework that harmonizes contextual sub-motion decomposition with tool-augmented reinforcement learning for open-vocabulary action recognition (OVAR). Unlike prior methods that treat actions as monolithic entities, our approach innovatively decomposes actions into discriminative sub-motions for fine-grained matching while dynamically invoking domain-specific tools for cross-modal interleaving, thereby enabling category-specific reasoning capacity and reducing cross-modal hallucination. Moreover, by designing a hierarchical reward that balances tool-usage efficiency, sub-motion relevance, and structural coherence in reasoning, our method autonomously leverages external tools to prioritize sub-motion patterns without explicit supervision, transmitting from text-centric reasoning to visually grounded inference. Extensive evaluations on HMDB-51, UCF-101, SSv2, Kinetics-400, and Kinetics-600 datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in distinguishing fine-grained actions and handling cross-modal hallucination, validating our excellent robustness and generalization.<br>

Existing red teaming methods often rely on seed instructions, which limits the semantic diversity of the synthesized adversarial prompts. We propose AutoRed, a free-form adversarial prompt generation framework that removes the need for seed instructions. AutoRed operates in two stages: (1) persona-guided adversarial instruction generation, and (2) a reflection loop to iteratively refine low-quality prompts. To improve efficiency, we introduce a verifier to assess prompt harmfulness without querying the target models. Using AutoRed, we build two red teaming datasets -- AutoRed-Medium and AutoRed-Hard -- and evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs. AutoRed achieves higher attack success rates and better generalization than existing baselines.

However, existing evaluation metrics, which focus on semantic and temporal alignment, overlook a critical failure mode: models often generate acoustic events, particularly speech and music, that have no corresponding visual source. We term this phenomenon Insertion Hallucination and identify it as a systemic risk driven by dataset biases, such as the prevalence of off-screen sounds, that remains completely undetected by current metrics. To address this challenge, we first develop a systematic evaluation framework that employs a majority-voting ensemble of multiple audio event detectors. We also introduce two novel metrics to quantify the prevalence and severity of this issue: IH@vid (the fraction of videos with hallucinations) and IH@dur (the fraction of hallucinated duration). Building on this, we propose Posterior Feature Correction, a novel training-free inference-time method that mitigates IH. PFC operates in a two-pass process: it first generates an initial audio output to detect hallucinated segments, and then regenerates the audio after masking the corresponding video features at those timestamps. Experiments on several mainstream V2A benchmarks first reveal that state-of-the-art models suffer from severe IH. In contrast, our PFC method reduces both the prevalence and duration of hallucinations by over 50\% on average, without degrading, and in some cases even improving, conventional metrics for audio quality and temporal synchronization. Our work is the first to formally define, systematically measure, and effectively mitigate Insertion Hallucination, paving the way for more reliable and faithful V2A models.<br>

Efforts in recent work shift from directly prompting large language models to training an end-to-end formalizer model from scratch, achieving remarkable advancements. However, existing formalizer still struggles to consistently generate valid statements that meet syntactic validity and semantic consistency. To address this issue, we propose the Autoformalizer with Tool Feedback (ATF), a novel approach that incorporates syntactic and consistency information as tools into the formalization process. By integrating Lean 4 compilers for syntax corrections and employing a multi-LLMs-as-judge approach for consistency validation, the model is able to adaptively refine generated statements according to the tool feedback, enhancing both syntactic validity and semantic consistency. The training of ATF involves a cold-start phase on synthetic tool-calling data, an expert iteration phase to improve formalization capabilities, and Direct Preference Optimization to alleviate ineffective revisions. Experimental results show that ATF markedly outperforms a range of baseline formalizer models, with its superior performance further validated by human evaluations. Subsequent analysis reveals that ATF demonstrates excellent inference scaling properties.

Recently, ultrasound foundation models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in cardiac ultrasound image analysis. However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound images is a prerequisite for accurate diagnosis. Due to the exceptionally high operational difficulty of cardiac ultrasound, there is a shortage of highly skilled personnel, which hinders patients from receiving timely examination services. In this paper, we aim to adapt the medical knowledge learned by foundation models from vast datasets to the probe guidance task, which is designed to provide real-time operational recommendations for junior sonographers to acquire high-quality ultrasound images. Moreover, inspired by the practice where experts optimize action decisions based on past explorations, we meticulously design a parameter-efficient Vision-Action Adapter (VA-Adapter) to enable foundation model's image encoder to encode vision-action sequences, thereby enhancing guidance performance. With built-in sequential reasoning capabilities in a compact design, the VA-Adapter enables a pre-trained ultrasound foundation model to learn precise probe adjustment strategies by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the VA-Adapter can surpass strong probe guidance models. Our code will be released after acceptance.<br>

However, existing ICL approaches face challenges in reconciling scalability with robustness across diverse tasks and noisy contextual examples: manually selecting examples produces clean contexts but is labor-intensive and task-specific, while similarity-based retrieval improves scalability but could introduce irrelevant or structurally inconsistent samples that degrade ICL performance. To address these limitations, we propose ContextNav, the first agentic framework that integrates the scalability of automated retrieval with the quality and adaptiveness of human-like curation, enabling noise-robust and dynamically optimized contextualization for multimodal ICL. ContextNav unifies context management and noise-robust contextualization within a closed-loop workflow driven by graph-based orchestration. Specifically, it builds a resource-aware multimodal embedding pipeline, maintains a retrievable vector database, and applies agentic retrieval and structural alignment to construct noise-resilient contexts. An Operational Grammar Graph (OGG) further supports adaptive workflow planning and optimization, enabling the agent to refine its operational strategies based on downstream ICL feedback.

Unfortunately, existing methods address this issue by imitating expert trajectories, which improve effectiveness but neglect diversity. To address this, we argue that the expert only needs to provide guidance only at critical decision points rather than the entire reasoning path.

This capability is attracting increasing attention, as it enhances multimodal understanding in real-world applications and underpins coherent content creation in film and media. As the most comprehensive benchmark for this task, ShotBench spans a wide range of cinematic concepts and VQA-style evaluations, with ShotVL achieving state-of-the-art results on it. However, our analysis reveals that ambiguous option design in ShotBench and ShotVL's shortcomings in reasoning consistency and instruction adherence undermine evaluation reliability, limiting fair comparison and hindering future progress. To overcome these issues, we systematically refine ShotBench through consistent option restructuring, conduct the first critical analysis of ShotVL's reasoning behavior, and introduce an extended evaluation protocol that jointly assesses task accuracy and core model competencies. These efforts lead to RefineShot, a refined and expanded benchmark that enables more reliable assessment and fosters future advances in cinematography understanding.<br>

However, it faces significant challenges related to complexity and scalability as the number of antennas increases. Artificial intelligence (AI), a cornerstone of next-generation wireless networks, offers considerable potential for addressing these challenges. This paper proposes an AI-driven, universal MIMO receiver architecture based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Unlike existing AI-based methods that treat receiver processing as a black box, our MCMC-based approach functions as a generic Bayesian computing engine applicable to various processing tasks, including channel estimation, symbol detection, and channel decoding. This method enhances the interpretability, scalability, and flexibility of receivers in diverse scenarios. Furthermore, the proposed approach integrates these tasks into a unified probabilistic framework, thereby enabling overall performance optimization. This unified framework can also be seamlessly combined with data-driven learning methods to facilitate the development of fully intelligent communication receivers.<br>

Most existing methods apply fixed or random transformations. However, we find that sample difficulty evolves along with the model's generalization capabilities in dynamic training environments. As a result, applying uniform or stochastic augmentations, without accounting for such dynamics, can lead to a mismatch between augmented data and the model's evolving training needs, ultimately degrading training effectiveness. To address this, we introduce SADA, a Sample-Aware Dynamic Augmentation that performs on-the-fly adjustment of augmentation strengths based on each sample's evolving influence on model optimization. Specifically, we estimate each sample's influence by projecting its gradient onto the accumulated model update direction and computing the temporal variance within a local training window. Samples with low variance, indicating stable and consistent influence, are augmented more strongly to emphasize diversity, while unstable samples receive milder transformations to preserve semantic fidelity and stabilize learning. Our method is lightweight, which does not require auxiliary models or policy tuning. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines as a plug-and-play module. Experiments across various benchmark datasets and model architectures show consistent improvements of SADA, including +7.3\% on fine-grained tasks and +4.3\% on long-tailed datasets, highlighting the method's effectiveness and practicality.<br>

We introduce PuzzlePlex, a benchmark designed to assess these capabilities through a diverse set of puzzles. PuzzlePlex consists of 15 types of puzzles, including deterministic and stochastic games of varying difficulty, as well as single-player and two-player scenarios. The PuzzlePlex framework provides a comprehensive environment for each game, and supports extensibility to generate more challenging instances as foundation models evolve. Additionally, we implement customized game-playing strategies for comparison. Building on this benchmark, we develop fine-grained metrics to measure performance and conduct an in-depth analysis of frontier foundation models across two settings: instruction-based and code-based.

A common mitigation strategy is to provide attribution to LLM outputs. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on simple attribution that retrieves supporting textual evidence as references. We argue that in real-world scenarios such as financial applications, attribution goes beyond reference retrieval. We introduce FinLFQA, a benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate long-form answers to complex financial questions with reliable and nuanced attributions. FinLFQA evaluates three critical aspects of attribution through human annotations: (1) supporting evidence extracted from financial reports, (2) intermediate numerical reasoning steps, and (3) domain-specific financial knowledge that informs the reasoning process. We further provide an automatic evaluation framework covering both answer quality and attribution quality. Through extensive experiments on eight LLMs across multiple attribution-generation paradigms, we find that fine-grained metrics are important to distinguish model capabilities, that end-to-end generation achieves comparable performance to post-hoc approaches, and that iterative refinement only helps when guided by external feedback.<br>

In this paper, we present CodeChemist, a novel and efficient framework for test-time scaling that enables functional knowledge transfer from high-resource to low-resource PLs using generated test cases. CodeChemist first generates and executes code in high-resource PLs to create test cases that encapsulate functional knowledge. It then uses multi-temperature hedged sampling to generate code snippets in the low-resource PL and selects the best one based on the pass rate of the test cases. Our extensive experiments show that CodeChemist outperforms existing test-time scaling approaches, boosting the performance of code generation for low-resource PLs without requiring any model retraining.<br>

These models have demonstrated strong performance across diverse tasks, including image understanding, video understanding, complex visual reasoning, and embodied AI. Despite these noteworthy successes, a fundamental question remains: Can VLMs count objects correctly? In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective benchmark, VLMCountBench, designed under a minimalist setting with only basic geometric shapes (e.g., triangles, circles) and their compositions, focusing exclusively on counting tasks without interference from other factors. We adopt strict independent variable control and systematically study the effects of simple properties such as color, size, and prompt refinement in a controlled ablation. Our empirical results reveal that while VLMs can count reliably when only one shape type is present, they exhibit substantial failures when multiple shape types are combined (i.e., compositional counting). This highlights a fundamental empirical limitation of current VLMs and motivates important directions for future research.<br>

Duplex SDS models address this by predicting output continuously, including silence tokens, thus removing the need for explicit VAD. However, they often have complex dual-channel architecture and lag behind cascaded models in semantic reasoning. To overcome these challenges, we propose SCoT: a Streaming Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework for Duplex SDS, alternating between processing fixed-duration user input and generating responses in a blockwise manner. Using frame-level alignments, we create intermediate targets-aligned user transcripts and system responses for each block. Experiments show that our approach produces more coherent and interpretable responses than existing duplex methods while supporting lower-latency and overlapping interactions compared to turn-by-turn systems.<br>

Test-time detoxification methods, which typically introduce static or dynamic interventions into LLM representations, offer a promising solution due to their flexibility and minimal invasiveness. However, current approaches often suffer from imprecise interventions, primarily due to their insufficient exploration of the transition space between toxic and non-toxic outputs. To address this challenge, we propose \textsc{A}utoregressive \textsc{R}eward \textsc{G}uided \textsc{R}epresentation \textsc{E}diting (ARGRE), a novel test-time detoxification framework that explicitly models toxicity transitions within the latent representation space, enabling stable and precise reward-guided editing. ARGRE identifies non-toxic semantic directions and interpolates between toxic and non-toxic representations to reveal fine-grained transition trajectories. These trajectories transform sparse toxicity annotations into dense training signals, enabling the construction of an autoregressive reward model that delivers stable and precise editing guidance. At inference, the reward model guides an adaptive two-step editing process to obtain detoxified representations: it first performs directional steering based on expected reward gaps to shift representations toward non-toxic regions, followed by lightweight gradient-based refinements. Extensive experiments across 8 widely used LLMs show that ARGRE significantly outperforms leading baselines in effectiveness (-62.21% toxicity) and efficiency (-47.58% inference time), while preserving the core capabilities of the original model with minimal degradation. Our code is available at the website.<br>

We discover that aligned models already possess robust internal safety beliefs: they consistently produce high-confidence refusals to harmful requests while exhibiting high entropy when generating potentially dangerous content. This entropy gap reveals an untapped signal--models intrinsically "know" when to refuse. We introduce Safety Instincts Reinforcement Learning (SIRL), which transforms this internal confidence into a self-generated reward signal, eliminating dependence on external validators or human annotations. SIRL teaches models to trust their safety instincts by reinforcing low-entropy refusal behaviors. Evaluated on Llama and Qwen models, SIRL maintains 89%+ Defense Success Rates (DSRs) against 20+ jailbreak methods, from static prompts to adaptive attacks. Using only 15,000 unlabeled prompts, SIRL surpasses resource-intensive supervised methods while preserving performance on mathematics, coding, and conversation benchmarks. Our work demonstrates that effective alignment can emerge from within, paving the way for more autonomous and robust AI safety mechanisms that scale without extensive human oversight.<br>

As real-world applications increasingly involve long history trajectories, e.g., LLM agent, it becomes indispensable to evaluate whether a model's responses are not only high-quality but also grounded in and consistent with the provided context. Yet, current RMs remain confined to short-context settings and primarily focus on response-level attributes (e.g., safety or helpfulness), while largely neglecting the critical dimension of long context-response consistency. In this work, we introduce Long-RewardBench, a benchmark specifically designed for long-context RM evaluation, featuring both Pairwise Comparison and Best-of-N tasks. Our preliminary study reveals that even state-of-the-art generative RMs exhibit significant fragility in long-context scenarios, failing to maintain context-aware preference judgments. Motivated by the analysis of failure patterns observed in model outputs, we propose a general multi-stage training strategy that effectively scales arbitrary models into robust Long-context RMs (LongRMs). Experiments show that our approach not only substantially improves performance on long-context evaluation but also preserves strong short-context capability. Notably, our 8B LongRM outperforms much larger 70B-scale baselines and matches the performance of the proprietary Gemini 2.5 Pro model.<br>

The success of LCMs can be attributed to their ability to locate implicit critical information within the context for further prediction. However, recent research reveals that LCMs are often susceptible to contextual noise, i.e., irrelevant tokens, that can mislead model attention. In this paper, we conduct a fine-grained analysis of the context noise and propose an effective metric, the Integrated Gradient (IG) score, to detect and quantify the noise information within the context. Our findings reveal that even simple mitigation of detected context noise can substantially boost the model's attention on critical tokens and benefit subsequent predictions. Building on this insight, we propose Context Denoising Training (CDT), a straightforward yet effective training strategy that improves attention on critical tokens while reinforcing their influence on model predictions. Extensive experiments across four tasks, under both context window scaling and long-context alignment settings, demonstrate the superiority of CDT. Notably, when trained with CDT, an open-source 8B model can achieve performance (50.92) comparable to GPT-4o (51.00).<br>

Existing methods are insufficient: merging-based approaches provide indirect, suboptimal control at the parameter level, often disregarding the impacts of multiple objectives. While decoding-based guidance is more direct, it typically requires aggregating logits from multiple expert models, incurring significant space overhead and relying heavily on individual model capacity. To address these issues, we introduce Merge-And-GuidE (MAGE), a two-stage framework that leverages model merging for guided decoding. We first identify a critical compatibility problem between the guidance and base models. In Stage 1, MAGE resolves this by dynamically constructing a more robust base model, merging a series of backbone models that account for multiple objectives. In Stage 2, we merge explicit and implicit value models into a unified guidance proxy, which then steers the decoding of the base model from Stage 1. Our analysis empirically validates Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC) in value models, explores the relationship between model merging and prediction ensembling, and demonstrates the enhanced controllability afforded by our approach. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior controllability, Pareto-optimal performance, and enhanced adaptability.<br>

When migrating models from cloud to devices, resource heterogeneity inevitably necessitates model compression. Recent quantization methods show promise for efficient deployment, yet they overlook device-specific user interests, resulting in compromised recommendation accuracy. While on-device finetuning captures personalized user preference, it imposes additional computational burden through local retraining. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for \underline{\textbf{C}}ustomizing \underline{\textbf{H}}ybrid-precision \underline{\textbf{O}}n-device model for sequential \underline{\textbf{R}}ecommendation with \underline{\textbf{D}}evice-cloud collaboration (\textbf{CHORD}), leveraging channel-wise mixed-precision quantization to simultaneously achieve personalization and resource-adaptive deployment. CHORD distributes randomly initialized models across heterogeneous devices and identifies user-specific critical parameters through auxiliary hypernetwork modules on the cloud. Our parameter sensitivity analysis operates across multiple granularities (layer, filter, and element levels), enabling precise mapping from user profiles to quantization strategy. Through on-device mixed-precision quantization, CHORD delivers dynamic model adaptation and accelerated inference without backpropagation, eliminating costly retraining cycles. We minimize communication overhead by encoding quantization strategies using only 2 bits per channel instead of 32-bit weights.

Existing methods rely on paired datasets or hand-crafted rewards, which limit scalability and generalization. We propose TrajSkill, a framework for Trajectory Conditioned Cross-embodiment Skill Transfer, enabling robots to acquire manipulation skills directly from human demonstration videos. Our key insight is to represent human motions as sparse optical flow trajectories, which serve as embodiment-agnostic motion cues by removing morphological variations while preserving essential dynamics. Conditioned on these trajectories together with visual and textual inputs, TrajSkill jointly synthesizes temporally consistent robot manipulation videos and translates them into executable actions, thereby achieving cross-embodiment skill transfer. Extensive experiments are conducted, and the results on simulation data (MetaWorld) show that TrajSkill reduces FVD by 39.6\% and KVD by 36.6\% compared with the state-of-the-art, and improves cross-embodiment success rate by up to 16.7\%. Real-robot experiments in kitchen manipulation tasks further validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating practical human-to-robot skill transfer across embodiments.<br>

Selecting the right LLM for each query is fundamentally an online decision problem: models differ in strengths, prices fluctuate, and users value accuracy and cost differently. Yet most routers are trained offline with labels for all candidate models, an assumption that breaks in deployment, where only the outcome of the chosen model is observed. We bridge this gap with BaRP, a Bandit-feedback Routing with Preferences approach that trains under the same partial-feedback restriction as deployment, while supporting preference-tunable inference: operators can dial the performance/cost trade-off at test time without retraining. Framed as a contextual bandit over prompt features and a user preference vector, our method simulates an online feedback setting during training and adapts its routing decisions to each new prompt, rather than depending on full-information offline supervision. Comprehensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms strong offline routers by at least 12.46% and the largest LLM by at least 2.45%, and generalizes robustly for unseen tasks.<br>

Machine-learned operators (MLOs) have been introduced as a means to achieve this modeling goal, as this class of architecture can perform inference at arbitrary resolution. In this work, we evaluate whether this architectural innovation is sufficient to perform "zero-shot super-resolution," namely to enable a model to serve inference on higher-resolution data than that on which it was originally trained. We comprehensively evaluate both zero-shot sub-resolution and super-resolution (i.e., multi-resolution) inference in MLOs. We decouple multi-resolution inference into two key behaviors: 1) extrapolation to varying frequency information; and 2) interpolating across varying resolutions. We empirically demonstrate that MLOs fail to do both of these tasks in a zero-shot manner. Consequently, we find MLOs are not able to perform accurate inference at resolutions different from those on which they were trained, and instead they are brittle and susceptible to aliasing. To address these failure modes, we propose a simple, computationally-efficient, and data-driven multi-resolution training protocol that overcomes aliasing and that provides robust multi-resolution generalization.<br>

We further introduce a self-adaptive router powered by large language models (LLMs), which autonomously learns effective restoration strategies by observing tool usage patterns. To assess intermediate and final processed video quality, we construct the \underline{Res}tored \underline{V}ideo \underline{Q}uality (Res-VQ) dataset and design a dedicated VLM-based video quality assessment (VQA) model tailored for restoration tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoA-VR effectively handles diverse and compound degradations, consistently outperforming existing baselines in terms of both objective metrics and perceptual quality.

However, under matched compute, recursive models with fewer parameters often lag behind non-recursive counterparts. By probing hidden states, we trace this performance gap to two primary bottlenecks: undifferentiated computation, where the core is forced to adopt a similar computational pattern at every iteration, and information overload, where long-lived and transient information must coexist in a single hidden state. To address the issues, we introduce a Memory-as-State-Highways (MeSH) scheme, which externalizes state management into an explicit memory buffer and employs lightweight routers to dynamically diversify computation across iterations. Probing visualizations confirm that MeSH successfully resolves the pathologies by inducing functional specialization across iterations. On the Pythia suite (160M-1.4B), MeSH-enhanced recursive transformers consistently improve over recursive baselines and outperforms its larger non-recursive counterpart at the 1.4B scale, improving average downstream accuracy by +1.06% with 33% fewer non-embedding parameters.

However, existing benchmarks for this task suffer from a fundamental methodological trilemma, forcing a trade-off between scientific relevance, scalability, and resistance to memorization. Furthermore, they oversimplify discovery as static function fitting, failing to capture the authentic scientific process of uncovering embedded laws through the interactive exploration of complex model systems. To address these critical gaps, we introduce NewtonBench, a benchmark comprising 324 scientific law discovery tasks across 12 physics domains. Our design mitigates the evaluation trilemma by using metaphysical shifts - systematic alterations of canonical laws - to generate a vast suite of problems that are scalable, scientifically relevant, and memorization-resistant. Moreover, we elevate the evaluation from static function fitting to interactive model discovery, requiring agents to experimentally probe simulated complex systems to uncover hidden principles. Our extensive experiment reveals a clear but fragile capability for discovery in frontier LLMs: this ability degrades precipitously with increasing system complexity and exhibits extreme sensitivity to observational noise. Notably, we uncover a paradoxical effect of tool assistance: providing a code interpreter can hinder more capable models by inducing a premature shift from exploration to exploitation, causing them to satisfice on suboptimal solutions. These results demonstrate that robust, generalizable discovery in complex, interactive environments remains the core challenge. By providing a scalable, robust, and scientifically authentic testbed, NewtonBench offers a crucial tool for measuring true progress and guiding the development of next-generation AI agents capable of genuine scientific discovery.<br>

Conventional methods adopt planning with actions where a executable action list would be provided as reference. However, this action representation choice would be impractical when the environment action space is combinatorial exploded (e.g., open-ended real world). This naturally leads to a question: As environmental action space scales, what is the optimal action representation for long-horizon agents? In this paper, we systematically study the effectiveness of two different action representations. The first one is conventional planning with actions (PwA) which is predominantly adopted for its effectiveness on existing benchmarks. The other one is planning with schemas (PwS) which instantiate an action schema into action lists (e.g., "move [OBJ] to [OBJ]" -> "move apple to desk") to ensure concise action space and reliable scalability. This alternative is motivated by its alignment with human cognition and its compliance with environment-imposed action format restriction. We propose cognitive bandwidth perspective as a conceptual framework to qualitatively understand the differences between these two action representations and empirically observe a representation-choice inflection point between ALFWorld (~35 actions) and SciWorld (~500 actions), which serve as evidence of the need for scalable representations. We further conduct controlled experiments to study how the location of this inflection point interacts with different model capacities: stronger planning proficiency shifts the inflection rightward, whereas better schema instantiation shifts it leftward. Finally, noting the suboptimal performance of PwS agents, we provide an actionable guide for building more capable PwS agents for better scalable autonomy.<br>

We present CLAQS, a compact, fully quantum token mixer for text classification that jointly learns complex-valued mixing and nonlinear transformations within a unified quantum circuit. To enable stable end-to-end optimization, we apply l1 normalization to regulate amplitude scaling and introduce a two-stage parameterized quantum architecture that decouples shared token embeddings from a window-level quantum feed-forward module. Operating under a sliding-window regime with document-level aggregation, CLAQS requires only eight data qubits and shallow circuits, yet achieves 91.64% accuracy on SST-2 and 87.08% on IMDB, outperforming both classical Transformer baselines and strong hybrid quantum-classical counterparts.<br>

However, as the landscape of reasoning models rapidly expands, a critical question remains: how can we systematically compare and evaluate the test-time scaling capabilities across different models? In this paper, we introduce ARISE (Adaptive Resolution-aware Scaling Evaluation), a novel metric specifically designed to assess the test-time scaling effectiveness of large reasoning models. Unlike existing evaluation approaches, ARISE incorporates two key innovations: (1) sample-level awareness that effectively penalizes negative scaling behaviors where increased computation leads to performance degradation, and (2) a dynamic sampling mechanism that mitigates the impact of accuracy fluctuations and token count instability on the final assessment. We conduct comprehensive experiments evaluating state-of-the-art reasoning models across diverse domains including mathematical reasoning, code generation, and agentic tasks. Our results demonstrate that ARISE provides a reliable and fine-grained measurement of test-time scaling capabilities, revealing significant variations in scaling efficiency across models. Notably, our evaluation identifies Claude Opus as exhibiting superior scaling characteristics compared to other contemporary reasoning models.<br>

To achieve this, we propose TimePD, the first source-free time series forecasting framework with proxy denoising, where large language models (LLMs) are employed to benefit from their generalization capabilities. Specifically, TimePD consists of three key components: (1) dual-branch invariant disentangled feature learning that enforces representation- and gradient-wise invariance by means of season-trend decomposition; (2) lightweight, parameter-free proxy denoising that dynamically calibrates systematic biases of LLMs; and (3) knowledge distillation that bidirectionally aligns the denoised prediction and the original target prediction.

To achieve this goal, recent methods seek to construct a large-scale instruction tuning dataset to empower the MLLM with quality perception ability following the well-known scaling law. However, a large amount of instruction tuning data may cause substantial computational costs and redundant data, which in turn will cause harm to the performance of the model. To cope with this problem, in this paper, we challenge the scaling law and systematically investigate the role of data quality of the instruction tuning dataset for explainable IQA. Using a powerful pre-trained MLLM, we first investigate the changes in model performance after fine-tuning with different sizes of instruction tuning data. We find that selecting a subset of the data set randomly using an appropriate ratio can even lead to better results than training with the entire instruction tuning dataset, demonstrating the redundancy of current explainable IQA instruction tuning data. Beyond randomly sampling a subset, we propose a clustering-based data selection framework with three stages: clustering feature extraction, cluster quota allocation, and cluster sampling strategy. Then we systematically analyze the choices of each stage and propose a simple but efficient data selection method IQA-Select for explainable IQA. The experimental results demonstrate that IQA-Select can achieve 102.1% and 103.7% performance of full fine-tuning using only 10% selected data in Q-Bench and AesBench respectively, significantly reducing computational costs while achieving better performance.<br>

While emerging literature suggests that reasoning data is increasingly incorporated also during the mid-training stage-a practice that is relatively more proprietary and less openly characterized-the role of such data in pretraining remains unclear. In particular, due to the opaqueness of pretraining corpora in most frontier models, the effect of reasoning data introduced at different phases of pre- and/or post-training is relatively less reported in the scientific literature. This raises several important questions: Is adding reasoning data earlier during pretraining any better than introducing it during post-training? Could earlier inclusion risk overfitting and harm generalization, or instead establish durable foundations that later fine-tuning cannot recover? We conduct the first systematic study of how reasoning data-varying in scale, diversity, and quality-affects LLM performance when introduced at different stages of training. We find that front-loading reasoning data into pretraining is critical (19% avg gain), establishing foundational capabilities that cannot be fully replicated by later-stage SFT, even with more data. We uncover an asymmetric principle for optimal data allocation: pretraining benefits most from broad diversity in reasoning patterns (11% avg gain), while SFT is more sensitive to data quality (15% avg gain). We show that high-quality pretraining data has latent effects, activated only after SFT, and that naively scaling SFT data can be detrimental, washing away the benefits of early reasoning injection. Our results challenge the conventional separation of language modeling and reasoning, providing a principled guide for strategically allocating data across the entire training pipeline to build more capable models.<br>

However, standard on-policy training discards rollout experiences after a single update, leading to computational inefficiency and instability. While prior work on RL has highlighted the benefits of reusing past experience, the role of experience characteristics in shaping learning dynamics of large reasoning models remains underexplored. In this paper, we are the first to investigate what makes a reasoning experience valuable and identify rollout correctness and entropy as effective indicators of experience value. Based on these insights, we propose ExGRPO (Experiential Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that organizes and prioritizes valuable experiences, and employs a mixed-policy objective to balance exploration with experience exploitation. Experiments on five backbone models (1.5B-8B parameters) show that ExGRPO consistently improves reasoning performance on mathematical/general benchmarks, with an average gain of +3.5/7.6 points over on-policy RLVR.

This shift is largely pragmatic: conventional value functions are computationally expensive to train at LLM scale and often fail under sparse rewards and long reasoning horizons. We revisit this bottleneck from an architectural perspective and introduce Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization (AsyPPO), a simple and scalable framework that restores the critics role while remaining efficient in large-model settings. AsyPPO employs a set of lightweight mini-critics, each trained on disjoint prompt shards. This design encourages diversity while preserving calibration, reducing value-estimation bias. Beyond robust estimation, AsyPPO leverages inter-critic uncertainty to refine the policy update: (i) masking advantages in states where critics agree and gradients add little learning signal, and (ii) filtering high-divergence states from entropy regularization, suppressing spurious exploration. After training on open-source data with only 5,000 samples, AsyPPO consistently improves learning stability and performance across multiple benchmarks over strong baselines, such as GRPO, achieving performance gains of more than six percent on Qwen3-4b-Base and about three percent on Qwen3-8b-Base and Qwen3-14b-Base over classic PPO, without additional tricks. These results highlight the importance of architectural innovations for scalable, efficient algorithms.<br>

Reinforcement learning, while powerful in scaling reasoning, is introduced only as the very last phase of post-training, preceded by supervised fine-tuning. While dominant, is this an optimal way of training? In this paper, we present RLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the core spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of pretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory action, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for predicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the model to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the reward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when conditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to conditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense reward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream during pretraining. Specifically, RLP reframes reinforcement learning for reasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between next-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning. Pretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base lifts the overall average across an eight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%. With identical post-training, the gains compound, with the largest improvements on reasoning-heavy tasks such as AIME25 and MMLU-Pro. Applying RLP to the hybrid Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2 increases the overall average from 42.81% to 61.32% and raises the average on scientific reasoning by 23%, demonstrating scalability across architectures and model sizes.<br>

Recent work ProRL has shown promise in scaling RL by increasing the number of training steps. However, performance plateaus after thousands of steps, with clear diminishing returns from allocating more computation to additional training. In this work, we investigate a complementary paradigm for scaling RL, BroR-Lincreasing the number of rollouts per example to hundreds to exhaustively Broaden exploration, which yields continuous performance gains beyond the saturation point observed in ProRL when scaling the number of training steps. Our approach is motivated by a mass balance equation analysis allowing us to characterize the rate of change in probability mass for correct and incorrect tokens during the reinforcement process. We show that under a one-step RL assumption, sampled rollout tokens always contribute to correct-mass expansion, while unsampled tokens outside rollouts may lead to gains or losses depending on their distribution and the net reward balance. Importantly, as the number of rollouts per example N increases, the effect of unsampled terms diminishes, ensuring overall correct-mass expansion. To validate our theoretical analysis, we conduct simulations under more relaxed conditions and find that a sufficiently large rollout size N-corresponding to ample exploration-guarantees an increase in the probability mass of all correct tokens. Empirically, BroRL revives models saturated after 3K ProRL training steps and demonstrates robust, continuous improvement, achieving state-of-the-art results for the 1.5B model across diverse benchmarks.<br>

Neural formulations such as Neural Radiance Fields provide high expressivity but require costly ray marching for rendering, whereas primitive-based methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting offer real-time efficiency through splatting, yet at the expense of representational power. Inspired by advances in both these directions, we introduce splattable neural primitives, a new volumetric representation that reconciles the expressivity of neural models with the efficiency of primitive-based splatting. Each primitive encodes a bounded neural density field parameterized by a shallow neural network. Our formulation admits an exact analytical solution for line integrals, enabling efficient computation of perspectively accurate splatting kernels. As a result, our representation supports integration along view rays without the need for costly ray marching. The primitives flexibly adapt to scene geometry and, being larger than prior analytic primitives, reduce the number required per scene. On novel-view synthesis benchmarks, our approach matches the quality and speed of 3D Gaussian Splatting while using $10\times$ fewer primitives and $6\times$ fewer parameters. These advantages arise directly from the representation itself, without reliance on complex control or adaptation frameworks. The project page is https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/SplatNet/.<br>

This is currently only possible through the use of external tools or extensive reasoning chains, either limiting the numerical intuition of LLMs or limiting the length of problems they can solve. We show that frontier LLMs require excessive amounts of reasoning tokens to solve even basic calculations, which is exacerbated by their tokenization strategies that split single numbers into multiple tokens. This motivates the need for efficient and effective single-token number encodings. We introduce a set of desiderata for such encodings and show that existing approaches fail to fulfill them. To address these shortcomings, we propose BitTokens, a novel tokenization strategy that embeds any number into a single token using its IEEE 754 binary floating-point representation. Through extensive experiments we show that our BitTokens allow even small language models to learn algorithms that solve basic arithmetic operations nearly perfectly. This newly gained efficiency could expand the length and complexity of problems language models can solve.<br>

However, existing LLM agents rely heavily on open-web search, which exposes two fundamental weaknesses: online content is noisy and unreliable, and many real-world tasks require precise, domain-specific knowledge unavailable from the web. The emergence of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) now allows agents to interface with thousands of specialized tools, seemingly resolving this limitation. Yet it remains unclear whether agents can effectively leverage such tools -- and more importantly, whether they can integrate them with general-purpose search to solve complex tasks. Therefore, we introduce InfoMosaic-Bench, the first benchmark dedicated to multi-source information seeking in tool-augmented agents. Covering six representative domains (medicine, finance, maps, video, web, and multi-domain integration), InfoMosaic-Bench requires agents to combine general-purpose search with domain-specific tools. Tasks are synthesized with InfoMosaic-Flow, a scalable pipeline that grounds task conditions in verified tool outputs, enforces cross-source dependencies, and filters out shortcut cases solvable by trivial lookup. This design guarantees both reliability and non-triviality. Experiments with 14 state-of-the-art LLM agents reveal three findings: (i) web information alone is insufficient, with GPT-5 achieving only 38.2% accuracy and 67.5% pass rate; (ii) domain tools provide selective but inconsistent benefits, improving some domains while degrading others; and (iii) 22.4% of failures arise from incorrect tool usage or selection, highlighting that current LLMs still struggle with even basic tool handling.<br>

However, these systems remain prone to hallucinations due to limited factual grounding. While text-based dialogue systems address this challenge by integrating tools such as web search and knowledge graph APIs, we introduce the first approach to extend tool use directly into speech-in speech-out systems. A key challenge is that tool integration substantially increases response latency, disrupting conversational flow. To mitigate this, we propose Streaming Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Streaming RAG), a novel framework that reduces user-perceived latency by predicting tool queries in parallel with user speech, even before the user finishes speaking. Specifically, we develop a post-training pipeline that teaches the model when to issue tool calls during ongoing speech and how to generate spoken summaries that fuse audio queries with retrieved text results, thereby improving both accuracy and responsiveness. To evaluate our approach, we construct AudioCRAG, a benchmark created by converting queries from the publicly available CRAG dataset into speech form. Experimental results demonstrate that our streaming RAG approach increases QA accuracy by up to 200% relative (from 11.1% to 34.2% absolute) and further enhances user experience by reducing tool use latency by 20%. Importantly, our streaming RAG approach is modality-agnostic and can be applied equally to typed input, paving the way for more agentic, real-time AI assistants.<br>

Although many studies addressed improving emission latency of transducers, little work has been explored for improving encoding latency of the block processing.

To efficiently compute with the small chunk shift, we propose a new encoder, Spiralformer, tailored for block processing by combining layer dropping and early exiting. We skip layer computation in a cyclic manner and shift the computed layer in each block spirally, which completes computation for all the layers over the block processing.

Through deteiled analysis of DeepSeek-R1's reasoning trajectories, we find that LLMs frequently encounter reasoning impasses and tend to output contradictory terms like "tricky" and "confused" when processing scenarios with multiple participants and timelines, leading to erroneous reasoning or infinite loops. The core issue is their inability to disentangle objective reality from agents' subjective beliefs. To address this, we propose an adaptive world model-enhanced reasoning mechanism that constructs a dynamic textual world model to track entity states and temporal sequences. It dynamically monitors reasoning trajectories for confusion indicators and promptly intervenes by providing clear world state descriptions, helping models navigate through cognitive dilemmas. The mechanism mimics how humans use implicit world models to distinguish between external events and internal beliefs. Evaluations on three social benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy (e.g., +10% in Hi-ToM) while reducing computational costs (up to 33.8% token reduction), offering a simple yet effective solution for deploying LLMs in social contexts.<br>

However, existing GFMs typically assume centralized access to multi-domain graphs, which is often infeasible due to privacy and institutional constraints. Federated Graph Foundation Models (FedGFMs) address this limitation, but their effectiveness fundamentally hinges on constructing a robust global codebook that achieves intra-domain coherence by consolidating mutually reinforcing semantics within each domain, while also maintaining inter-domain diversity by retaining heterogeneous knowledge across domains. To this end, we propose FedBook, a unified federated graph foundation codebook that systematically aggregates clients' local codebooks during server-side federated pre-training. FedBook follows a two-phase process: (1) Intra-domain Collaboration, where low-frequency tokens are refined by referencing more semantically reliable high-frequency tokens across clients to enhance domain-specific coherence; and (2) Inter-domain Integration, where client contributions are weighted by the semantic distinctiveness of their codebooks during the aggregation of the global GFM, thereby preserving cross-domain diversity. Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarks across multiple domains and tasks demonstrate that FedBook consistently outperforms 21 baselines, including isolated supervised learning, FL/FGL, federated adaptations of centralized GFMs, and FedGFM techniques.<br>

Although continuous-time consistency model (sCM) is theoretically principled and empirically powerful for accelerating academic-scale diffusion, its applicability to large-scale text-to-image and video tasks remains unclear due to infrastructure challenges in Jacobian-vector product (JVP) computation and the limitations of standard evaluation benchmarks. We first develop a parallelism-compatible FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel, enabling sCM training on models with over 10 billion parameters and high-dimensional video tasks. Our investigation reveals fundamental quality limitations of sCM in fine-detail generation, which we attribute to error accumulation and the "mode-covering" nature of its forward-divergence objective. To remedy this, we propose the score-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM), which incorporates score distillation as a long-skip regularizer. This integration complements sCM with the "mode-seeking" reverse divergence, effectively improving visual quality while maintaining high generation diversity. Validated on large-scale models (Cosmos-Predict2, Wan2.1) up to 14B parameters and 5-second videos, rCM matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art distillation method DMD2 on quality metrics while offering notable advantages in diversity, all without GAN tuning or extensive hyperparameter searches. The distilled models generate high-fidelity samples in only $1\sim4$ steps, accelerating diffusion sampling by $15\times\sim50\times$. These results position rCM as a practical and theoretically grounded framework for advancing large-scale diffusion distillation.<br>

While natural monolingual interaction has been achieved, we find existing models exhibit deficiencies in language alignment. In our proposed Code-Switching Speech-to-Speech Benchmark (CS3-Bench), experiments on 7 mainstream models demonstrate a relative performance drop of up to 66% in knowledge-intensive question answering and varying degrees of misunderstanding in open-ended conversations. Starting from a model with severe performance deterioration, we propose both data constructions and training approaches to improve the language alignment capabilities, specifically employing Chain of Recognition (CoR) to enhance understanding and Keyword Highlighting (KH) to guide generation. Our approach improves the knowledge accuracy from 25.14% to 46.13%, with open-ended understanding rate from 64.5% to 86.5%, and significantly reduces pronunciation errors in the secondary language.

This is because large inter-frame motions will increase the uncertainty of the solution space. For example, one pixel in the first frame might have more choices to reach the corresponding pixel in the second frame. Event cameras can asynchronously capture rapid visual changes and are robust to motion blur, but they do not provide color information. Intuitively, the event stream can provide deterministic constraints for the inter-frame large motion by the event trajectories. Hence, combining low-temporal-resolution images with high-framerate event streams can address this challenge. However, it is challenging to jointly optimize Dynamic 3DGS using both RGB and event modalities due to the significant discrepancy between these two data modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework that jointly optimizes dynamic 3DGS from the two modalities. The key idea is to adopt event motion priors to guide the optimization of the deformation fields. First, we extract the motion priors encoded in event streams by using the proposed LoCM unsupervised fine-tuning framework to adapt an event flow estimator to a certain unseen scene. Then, we present the geometry-aware data association method to build the event-Gaussian motion correspondence, which is the primary foundation of the pipeline, accompanied by two useful strategies, namely motion decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing image and event-based approaches across synthetic and real scenes and prove that our method can effectively optimize dynamic 3DGS with the help of event data.<br>

Existing methods often struggle to capture intricate feature interactions and adapt across diverse application scenarios. Recent advances employ generative intelligence to alleviate these drawbacks. However, these methods remain constrained by permutation sensitivity in embedding and reliance on convexity assumptions in gradient-based search. To address these limitations, our initial work introduces a novel framework that integrates permutation-invariant embedding with policy-guided search. Although effective, it still left opportunities to adapt to realistic distributed scenarios. In practice, data across local clients is highly imbalanced, heterogeneous and constrained by strict privacy regulations, limiting direct sharing. These challenges highlight the need for a framework that can integrate feature selection knowledge across clients without exposing sensitive information. In this extended journal version, we advance the framework from two perspectives: 1) developing a privacy-preserving knowledge fusion strategy to derive a unified representation space without sharing sensitive raw data. 2) incorporating a sample-aware weighting strategy to address distributional imbalance among heterogeneous local clients. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of our framework. The results further demonstrate its strong generalization ability in federated learning scenarios.

While existing works evaluate the LLMs' tool use capability, they largely focus on the final answers yet overlook the detailed tool usage trajectory, i.e., whether tools are selected, parameterized, and ordered correctly. We introduce TRAJECT-Bench, a trajectory-aware benchmark to comprehensively evaluate LLMs' tool use capability through diverse tasks with fine-grained evaluation metrics. TRAJECT-Bench pairs high-fidelity, executable tools across practical domains with tasks grounded in production-style APIs, and synthesizes trajectories that vary in breadth (parallel calls) and depth (interdependent chains). Besides final accuracy, TRAJECT-Bench also reports trajectory-level diagnostics, including tool selection and argument correctness, and dependency/order satisfaction. Analyses reveal failure modes such as similar tool confusion and parameter-blind selection, and scaling behavior with tool diversity and trajectory length where the bottleneck of transiting from short to mid-length trajectories is revealed, offering actionable guidance for LLMs' tool use.<br>

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by enriching LLMs with external knowledge, but existing systems primarily rely on unstructured documents, while largely overlooking relational databases, which provide precise, timely, and efficiently queryable factual information, serving as indispensable infrastructure in domains such as finance, healthcare, and scientific research. Motivated by this gap, we conduct a systematic analysis that reveals three central observations: (i) databases and documents offer complementary strengths across queries, (ii) naively combining both sources introduces noise and cost without consistent accuracy gains, and (iii) selecting the most suitable source for each query is crucial to balance effectiveness and efficiency. We further observe that query types show consistent regularities in their alignment with retrieval paths, suggesting that routing decisions can be effectively guided by systematic rules that capture these patterns. Building on these insights, we propose a rule-driven routing framework. A routing agent scores candidate augmentation paths based on explicit rules and selects the most suitable one; a rule-making expert agent refines the rules over time using QA feedback to maintain adaptability; and a path-level meta-cache reuses past routing decisions for semantically similar queries to reduce latency and cost. Experiments on three QA benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms static strategies and learned routing baselines, achieving higher accuracy while maintaining moderate computational cost.<br>

Existing LLM agents suffer from a critical limitation: they are test-time static and cannot learn from experience, lacking the ability to accumulate knowledge and continuously improve on the job. To address this challenge, we propose MUSE, a novel agent framework that introduces an experience-driven, self-evolving system centered around a hierarchical Memory Module. MUSE organizes diverse levels of experience and leverages them to plan and execute long-horizon tasks across multiple applications. After each sub-task execution, the agent autonomously reflects on its trajectory, converting the raw trajectory into structured experience and integrating it back into the Memory Module. This mechanism enables the agent to evolve beyond its static pretrained parameters, fostering continuous learning and self-evolution. We evaluate MUSE on the long-horizon productivity benchmark TAC. It achieves new SOTA performance by a significant margin using only a lightweight Gemini-2.5 Flash model. Sufficient Experiments demonstrate that as the agent autonomously accumulates experience, it exhibits increasingly superior task completion capabilities, as well as robust continuous learning and self-evolution capabilities. Moreover, the accumulated experience from MUSE exhibits strong generalization properties, enabling zero-shot improvement on new tasks. MUSE establishes a new paradigm for AI agents capable of real-world productivity task automation.<br>

Instead of costly end-to-end diffusion training, SDAR performs a lightweight paradigm conversion that transforms a well-trained autoregressive (AR) model into a blockwise diffusion model through brief, data-efficient adaptation. During inference, SDAR generates sequences autoregressively across blocks for global coherence while decoding all tokens within each block in parallel via a discrete diffusion process. Extensive experiments show that AR models remain substantially more compute-efficient than masked diffusion models, providing a strong foundation for adaptation. Building on this insight, SDAR achieves efficient AR-to-diffusion conversion with minimal cost, preserving AR-level performance while enabling parallel generation. Scaling studies across dense and Mixture-of-Experts architectures confirm that SDAR scales without compromise: larger models exhibit stronger robustness to block size and decoding thresholds, yielding greater speedups without accuracy loss. Beyond efficiency, SDAR demonstrates enhanced reasoning and domain adaptability. Our 30B MoE model surpasses its AR counterpart on challenging scientific reasoning benchmarks such as GPQA and ChemBench, and gains further improvements under test-time scaling methods like majority voting and pass@k. Together, these results establish SDAR as a practical paradigm that combines the strengths of autoregression and diffusion for scalable, high-throughput reasoning.<br>

Although humans can solve these tasks with ease, existing models, even after extensive pre-training and post-training at scale, still fail to perform reasoning reliably. In this paper, we revisit reasoning tasks from a causal perspective, seeking to understand their behavior in latent space and to offer insights for addressing their challenges. Specifically, we cast reasoning tasks as a selection mechanism, in which high-level logical concepts function as selection operators on the given observations, such as, identifying the correct answer in a math problem or filling the appropriate entry in Sudoku. We emphasize two key properties of this formulation that shed light on the difficulty of reasoning tasks. First, the latent space exceeds the observation space in complexity, even when the correct answer is fully determined by the observed input. Second, the latent variables, corresponding to logical thought, are densely structured and exhibit strong dependencies. Building on this formulation, we introduce a framework, called SR$^2$, that incorporates the estimated latent variables as feedback into the selection mechanism, thereby facilitating the learning of dense dependencies among latent representations. The framework consists of three key modules: reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and periodic intermediate alignment. Experimentally, we show that our approach yields significant gains in reasoning accuracy, for example, attaining over 10$\%$ improvement in performance with 8$\times$ fewer parameters on the Sudoku and Maze tasks over the recent advances.<br>

However, the underlying propagation dynamics constantly shift with new topics or events, which are modeled as changing coefficients of the underlying dynamics. Deep learning models struggle to adapt to these out-of-distribution shifts without extensive new data and retraining. To address this, we present Zero-Shot Forecasting of Network Dynamics through Weight Flow Matching (FNFM), a generative, coefficient-conditioned framework that generates dynamic model weights for an unseen target coefficient, enabling zero-shot forecasting. Our framework utilizes a Variational Encoder to summarize the forecaster weights trained in observed environments into compact latent tokens. A Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) module then learns a continuous transport from a simple Gaussian distribution to the empirical distribution of these weights, conditioned on the dynamical coefficients. This process is instantaneous at test time and requires no gradient-based optimization. Across varied dynamical coefficients, empirical results indicate that FNFM yields more reliable zero-shot accuracy than baseline methods, particularly under pronounced coefficient shift.<br>

In our experiments, we observe that this paradigm is highly susceptible to reward hacking, leading to a substantial overestimation of a model's reasoning ability. This is evidenced by a high incidence of false positives - solutions that reach the correct final answer through an unsound reasoning process. Through a systematic analysis with human verification, we establish a taxonomy of these failure modes, identifying patterns like Miracle Steps - abrupt jumps to a correct output without a valid preceding derivation. Probing experiments suggest a strong association between these Miracle Steps and memorization, where the model appears to recall the answer directly rather than deriving it. To mitigate this systemic issue, we introduce the Rubric Reward Model (RRM), a process-oriented reward function that evaluates the entire reasoning trajectory against problem-specific rubrics. The generative RRM provides fine-grained, calibrated rewards (0-1) that explicitly penalize logical flaws and encourage rigorous deduction. When integrated into a reinforcement learning pipeline, RRM-based training consistently outperforms outcome-only supervision across four math benchmarks. Notably, it boosts Verified Pass@1024 on AIME2024 from 26.7% to 62.6% and reduces the incidence of Miracle Steps by 71%. Our work demonstrates that rewarding the solution process is crucial for building models that are not only more accurate but also more reliable.<br>

Multi-task learning offers a principled framework to train these tasks jointly through shared representations. However, existing multi-task optimization strategies are primarily guided by training dynamics and often generalize poorly in volatile bidding environments. To this end, we present Validation-Aligned Multi-task Optimization (VAMO), which adaptively assigns task weights based on the alignment between per-task training gradients and a held-out validation gradient, thereby steering updates toward validation improvement and better matching deployment objectives. We further equip the framework with a periodicity-aware temporal module and couple it with an advanced generative auto-bidding backbone to enhance cross-task transfer of seasonal structure and strengthen bidding performance. Meanwhile, we provide theoretical insights into the proposed method, e.g., convergence guarantee and alignment analysis. Extensive experiments on both simulated and large-scale real-world advertising systems consistently demonstrate significant improvements over typical baselines, illuminating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.<br>

We revisit Mixout, a stochastic regularizer that intermittently replaces finetuned weights with their pretrained reference, through the lens of a single-run, weight-sharing implicit ensemble. This perspective reveals three key levers that govern robustness: the \emph{masking anchor}, \emph{resampling frequency}, and \emph{mask sparsity}. Guided by this analysis, we introduce GMixout, which (i) replaces the fixed anchor with an exponential moving-average snapshot that adapts during training, and (ii) regulates masking period via an explicit resampling-frequency hyperparameter. Our sparse-kernel implementation updates only a small fraction of parameters with no inference-time overhead, enabling training on consumer-grade GPUs. Experiments on benchmarks covering covariate shift, corruption, and class imbalance, ImageNet / ImageNet-LT, DomainNet, iWildCam, and CIFAR100-C, GMixout consistently improves in-domain accuracy beyond zero-shot performance while surpassing both Model Soups and strong parameter-efficient finetuning baselines under distribution shift.<br>

Dropout offers a lightweight alternative by simulating ensembles through random neuron deactivation; however, when applied to pre-trained models, it tends to over-regularize and disrupt critical representations necessary for generalization. In this work, we investigate Mixout, a stochastic regularization technique that provides an alternative to Dropout for domain generalization. Rather than deactivating neurons, Mixout mitigates overfitting by probabilistically swapping a subset of fine-tuned weights with their pre-trained counterparts during training, thereby maintaining a balance between adaptation and retention of prior knowledge. Our study reveals that achieving strong performance with Mixout on domain generalization benchmarks requires a notably high masking probability of 0.9 for ViTs and 0.8 for ResNets. While this may seem like a simple adjustment, it yields two key advantages for domain generalization: (1) higher masking rates more strongly penalize deviations from the pre-trained parameters, promoting better generalization to unseen domains; and (2) high-rate masking substantially reduces computational overhead, cutting gradient computation by up to 45% and gradient memory usage by up to 90%. Experiments across five domain generalization benchmarks, PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraIncognita, and DomainNet, using ResNet and ViT architectures, show that our approach, High-rate Mixout, achieves out-of-domain accuracy comparable to ensemble-based methods while significantly reducing training costs.<br>

Our prior work, IAR, initiated a direction to address this by reorganizing the visual codebook based on embedding similarity, thereby improving generation robustness. However, it is constrained by the rigidity of pre-trained codebooks and the inaccuracies of hard, uniform clustering. To overcome these limitations, we propose IAR2, an advanced autoregressive framework that enables a hierarchical semantic-detail synthesis process. At the core of IAR2 is a novel Semantic-Detail Associated Dual Codebook, which decouples image representations into a semantic codebook for global semantic information and a detail codebook for fine-grained refinements. It expands the quantization capacity from a linear to a polynomial scale, significantly enhancing expressiveness. To accommodate this dual representation, we propose a Semantic-Detail Autoregressive Prediction scheme coupled with a Local-Context Enhanced Autoregressive Head, which performs hierarchical prediction-first the semantic token, then the detail token-while leveraging a local context window to enhance spatial coherence. Furthermore, for conditional generation, we introduce a Progressive Attention-Guided Adaptive CFG mechanism that dynamically modulates the guidance scale for each token based on its relevance to the condition and its temporal position in the generation sequence, improving conditional alignment without sacrificing realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IAR2 sets a new state-of-the-art for autoregressive image generation, achieving a FID of 1.50 on ImageNet. Our model not only surpasses previous methods in performance but also demonstrates superior computational efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of our structured, coarse-to-fine generation strategy.<br>

Recent studies have explored token pruning to alleviate this problem, which typically uses text-vision cross-attention or [\texttt{CLS}] attention to assess and discard redundant visual tokens. In this work, we identify a critical limitation of such attention-first pruning approaches, i.e., they tend to preserve semantically similar tokens, resulting in pronounced performance drops under high pruning ratios. To this end, we propose {HoloV}, a simple yet effective, plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for efficient inference. Distinct from previous attention-first schemes, HoloV rethinks token retention from a holistic perspective. By adaptively distributing the pruning budget across different spatial crops, HoloV ensures that the retained tokens capture the global visual context rather than isolated salient features. This strategy minimizes representational collapse and maintains task-relevant information even under aggressive pruning. Experimental results demonstrate that our HoloV achieves superior performance across various tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios compared to SOTA methods. For instance, LLaVA1.5 equipped with HoloV preserves 95.8\% of the original performance after pruning 88.9\% of visual tokens, achieving superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.<br>

Current reinforcement learning approaches often rely on sparse, outcome-based rewards, which can reinforce flawed reasoning paths that lead to coincidentally correct answers. We argue that this stems from a fundamental mismatch with the natural structure of reasoning. We first propose a theoretical framework that formalizes complex problem solving as a hierarchical selection process, where an intractable global constraint is decomposed into a series of simpler, localized logical steps. This framework provides a principled foundation for algorithm design, including theoretical insights into the identifiability of this latent reasoning structure. Motivated by this theory, we identify unstructured refinement -- a failure mode where a model's iterative steps do not contribute meaningfully to the solution -- as a core deficiency in existing methods. We then introduce Step-Aware Policy Optimization (SAPO), a novel RL algorithm that aligns the dLLM's denoising process with the latent reasoning hierarchy. By using a process-based reward function that encourages incremental progress, SAPO guides the model to learn structured, coherent reasoning paths. Our empirical results show that this principled approach significantly improves performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks and enhances the interpretability of the generation process.<br>

However, the principles and values that guide these models when distributing scarce societal resources remain largely unexamined. To address this, we introduce the Social Welfare Function (SWF) Benchmark, a dynamic simulation environment where an LLM acts as a sovereign allocator, distributing tasks to a heterogeneous community of recipients. The benchmark is designed to create a persistent trade-off between maximizing collective efficiency (measured by Return on Investment) and ensuring distributive fairness (measured by the Gini coefficient). We evaluate 20 state-of-the-art LLMs and present the first leaderboard for social welfare allocation. Our findings reveal three key insights: (i) A model's general conversational ability, as measured by popular leaderboards, is a poor predictor of its allocation skill. (ii) Most LLMs exhibit a strong default utilitarian orientation, prioritizing group productivity at the expense of severe inequality. (iii) Allocation strategies are highly vulnerable, easily perturbed by output-length constraints and social-influence framing. These results highlight the risks of deploying current LLMs as societal decision-makers and underscore the need for specialized benchmarks and targeted alignment for AI governance.<br>

To address these limitations, we propose adaptive shared experts (ASE) within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) based MoE, where shared experts are assigned router-computed gating weights jointly normalized with sparse experts. This design facilitates STL to MTL transition, enhances expert specialization, and cooperation. Furthermore, we incorporate fine-grained experts by increasing the number of LoRA experts while proportionally reducing their rank, enabling more effective knowledge sharing under a comparable parameter budget.

Although existing vector quantization (VQ) methods reduce KV cache usage and provide flexible representational capacity across bit-widths, they suffer severe performance degradation at ultra-low bit-widths due to key cache outliers that hinder effective codebook utilization. To address this challenge, we propose VecInfer, a novel VQ method for aggressive KV cache compression while enabling efficient inference. By applying smooth and Hadamard transformations, VecInfer suppresses outliers in the key cache, enabling the codebook to comprehensively cover the original data distribution and thereby reducing quantization difficulty. To facilitate efficient deployment, we design an optimized CUDA kernel that fuses computation with dequantization to minimize memory access overhead. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that VecInfer consistently outperforms existing quantization baselines across both long-context understanding and mathematical reasoning tasks. With only 2-bit quantization, VecInfer achieves performance comparable to full precision, while delivering up to $\mathbf{2.7\times}$ speedup in large-batch self-attention computation and $\mathbf{8.3\times}$ reduction in single-batch end-to-end latency on Llama-3.1-8B with a 196k sequence length.<br>

Distilling multiple VFMs into a unified representation for policy can mitigate this limitation but often yields inflexible task-specific feature selection and requires costly full re-training to incorporate robot-domain knowledge. We propose VER, a Vision Expert transformer for Robot learning. During pretraining, VER distills multiple VFMs into a vision expert library. It then fine-tunes only a lightweight routing network (fewer than 0.4% of parameters) to dynamically select task-relevant experts from the pretrained library for downstream robot tasks. We further introduce Patchwise Expert Routing with Curriculum Top-K Annealing to improve both flexibility and precision of dynamic expert selection. Moreover, VER supports parameter-efficient finetuning for scalable expert utilization and adaptive robot-domain knowledge integration. Across 17 diverse robotic tasks and multiple policy heads, VER achieves state-of-the-art performance. We find that VER reduces large-norm outliers in task-irrelevant regions (e.g., background) and concentrates on task-critical regions.

Existing unlearning approaches for MLLMs typically adapt training-based strategies such as gradient ascent or preference optimization, but these methods are computationally expensive, irreversible, and often distort retained knowledge. In this work, we propose MLLMEraser, an input-aware, training-free framework for test-time unlearning. Our approach leverages activation steering to enable dynamic knowledge erasure without parameter updates. Specifically, we construct a multimodal erasure direction by contrasting adversarially perturbed, knowledge-recall image-text pairs with knowledge-erasure counterparts, capturing both textual and visual discrepancies. To prevent unnecessary interference, we further design an input-aware steering mechanism that adaptively determines when and how the erasure direction should be applied, preserving utility on retained knowledge while enforcing forgetting on designated content. Experiments on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL demonstrate that MLLMEraser consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM unlearning baselines, achieving stronger forgetting performance with lower computational cost and minimal utility degradation.<br>

However, by restricting the optimization objective as inducing a predefined target, these methods inherently constrain the adversarial search space, which limit their overall attack efficacy. Furthermore, existing methods typically require a large number of optimization iterations to fulfill the large gap between the fixed target and the original model response, resulting in low attack efficiency. To overcome the limitations of targeted jailbreak attacks, we propose the first gradient-based untargeted jailbreak attack (UJA), aiming to elicit an unsafe response without enforcing any predefined patterns. Specifically, we formulate an untargeted attack objective to maximize the unsafety probability of the LLM response, which can be quantified using a judge model. Since the objective is non-differentiable, we further decompose it into two differentiable sub-objectives for optimizing an optimal harmful response and the corresponding adversarial prompt, with a theoretical analysis to validate the decomposition. In contrast to targeted jailbreak attacks, UJA's unrestricted objective significantly expands the search space, enabling a more flexible and efficient exploration of LLM vulnerabilities.Extensive evaluations demonstrate that \textsc{UJA} can achieve over 80\% attack success rates against recent safety-aligned LLMs with only 100 optimization iterations, outperforming the state-of-the-art gradient-based attacks such as I-GCG and COLD-Attack by over 20\%.<br>

</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2510.02422">Dynamic Target Attack</a></div></span></div><div id='abs'>Abstract:<br><span id='abs'>Existing gradient-based jailbreak attacks typically optimize an adversarial suffix to induce a fixed affirmative response. However, this fixed target usually resides in an extremely low-density region of a safety-aligned LLM's output distribution conditioned on diverse harmful inputs. Due to the substantial discrepancy between the target and the original output, existing attacks require numerous iterations to optimize the adversarial prompt, which might still fail to induce the low-probability target response from the target LLM. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Target Attack (DTA), a new jailbreaking framework relying on the target LLM's own responses as targets to optimize the adversarial prompts. In each optimization round, DTA iteratively samples multiple candidate responses directly from the output distribution conditioned on the current prompt, and selects the most harmful response as a temporary target for prompt optimization. In contrast to existing attacks, DTA significantly reduces the discrepancy between the target and the output distribution, substantially easing the optimization process to search for an effective adversarial prompt. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of DTA: under the white-box setting, DTA only needs 200 optimization iterations to achieve an average attack success rate (ASR) of over 87\% on recent safety-aligned LLMs, exceeding the state-of-the-art baselines by over 15\%. The time cost of DTA is 2-26 times less than existing baselines. Under the black-box setting, DTA uses Llama-3-8B-Instruct as a surrogate model for target sampling and achieves an ASR of 85\% against the black-box target model Llama-3-70B-Instruct, exceeding its counterparts by over 25\%.<br>

However, such claims are typically drawn from narrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior. In this work, we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse dimensions, including evaluation protocols, task categories, and model architectures. Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less effective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with the evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation, pruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being critical. By contrast, generation-based evaluation uncovers indispensable roles for middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining long-range coherence. We further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in shallow components, whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers -- yet can be reshaped through distillation. These results highlight that depth usage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, underscoring the need for task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives in both interpreting and compressing large models.<br>

Recent works have attempted to improve efficiency by compressing visual tokens during training, either through modifications to model components or by introducing additional parameters. However, they often overlook the increased learning difficulty caused by such compression, as the model's parameter space struggles to quickly adapt to the substantial perturbations in the feature space induced by token compression. In this work, we propose to develop Efficient MLLMs via Progressive Consistency Distillation (EPIC), a progressive learning framework. Specifically, by decomposing the feature space perturbations introduced by token compression along the token-wise and layer-wise dimensions, we introduce token consistency distillation and layer consistency distillation, respectively, aiming to reduce the training difficulty by leveraging guidance from a teacher model and following a progressive learning trajectory. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness, robustness, and generalization capabilities of our proposed framework.<br>

This simultaneous listening and speaking design enables real-time interaction and the agent can handle dynamic conversational behaviors like user barge-in. However, during the listening phase, existing systems keep the agent idle by repeatedly predicting the silence token, which departs from human behavior: we usually engage in lightweight thinking during conversation rather than remaining absent-minded. Inspired by this, we propose Chronological Thinking, a on-the-fly conversational thinking mechanism that aims to improve response quality in full-duplex SDLMs. Specifically, chronological thinking presents a paradigm shift from conventional LLM thinking approaches, such as Chain-of-Thought, purpose-built for streaming acoustic input. (1) Strictly causal: the agent reasons incrementally while listening, updating internal hypotheses only from past audio with no lookahead. (2) No additional latency: reasoning is amortized during the listening window; once the user stops speaking, the agent halts thinking and begins speaking without further delay. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of chronological thinking through both objective metrics and human evaluations show consistent improvements in response quality. Furthermore, chronological thinking robustly handles conversational dynamics and attains competitive performance on full-duplex interaction metrics.<br>

Existing conditional generative adversarial networks often struggle to balance the dual objectives of assessing authenticity and conditional alignment of input samples within their conditional discriminators. To address this, we propose a novel discriminator design that integrates three key capabilities: unconditional discrimination, matching-aware supervision to enhance alignment sensitivity, and adaptive weighting to dynamically balance all objectives. Specifically, we introduce Sum of Naturalness and Alignment (SONA), which employs separate projections for naturalness (authenticity) and alignment in the final layer with an inductive bias, supported by dedicated objective functions and an adaptive weighting mechanism. Extensive experiments on class-conditional generation tasks show that \ours achieves superior sample quality and conditional alignment compared to state-of-the-art methods.

To investigate efficient samplers for masked diffusion, this paper theoretically analyzes the MaskGIT sampler for image modeling, revealing its implicit temperature sampling mechanism. Through this analysis, we introduce the "moment sampler," an asymptotically equivalent but more tractable and interpretable alternative to MaskGIT, which employs a "choose-then-sample" approach by selecting unmasking positions before sampling tokens. In addition, we improve the efficiency of choose-then-sample algorithms through two key innovations: a partial caching technique for transformers that approximates longer sampling trajectories without proportional computational cost, and a hybrid approach formalizing the exploration-exploitation trade-off in adaptive unmasking. Experiments in image and text domains demonstrate our theory as well as the efficiency of our proposed methods, advancing both theoretical understanding and practical implementation of masked diffusion samplers.<br>

In this paper, we introduce UniDoc-Bench, the first large-scale, realistic benchmark for MM-RAG built from 70k real-world PDF pages across eight domains. Our pipeline extracts and links evidence from text, tables, and figures, then generates 1,600 multimodal QA pairs spanning factual retrieval, comparison, summarization, and logical reasoning queries. To ensure reliability, 20% of QA pairs are validated by multiple annotators and expert adjudication. UniDoc-Bench supports apples-to-apples comparison across four paradigms: (1) text-only, (2) image-only, (3) multimodal text-image fusion, and (4) multimodal joint retrieval -- under a unified protocol with standardized candidate pools, prompts, and evaluation metrics. Our experiments show that multimodal text-image fusion RAG systems consistently outperform both unimodal and jointly multimodal embedding-based retrieval, indicating that neither text nor images alone are sufficient and that current multimodal embeddings remain inadequate.

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) provides a powerful lens into large-scale functional connectivity, where brain regions are modeled as nodes and inter-regional synchrony as edges, offering clinically relevant biomarkers for psychiatric disorders. While prior works use graph neural network (GNN) approaches for disorder prediction, they remain complex black-boxes, limiting their reliability and clinical translation. In this work, we propose CONCEPTNEURO, a concept-based diagnosis framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and neurobiological domain knowledge to automatically generate, filter, and encode interpretable functional connectivity concepts. Each concept is represented as a structured subgraph linking specific brain regions, which are then passed through a concept classifier. Our design ensures predictions through clinically meaningful connectivity patterns, enabling both interpretability and strong predictive performance. Extensive experiments across multiple psychiatric disorder datasets demonstrate that CONCEPTNEURO-augmented GNNs consistently outperform their vanilla counterparts, improving accuracy while providing transparent, clinically aligned explanations.

Thanks to the advent of new spectrum resources and degrees of freedom brought by the near-field propagation, the mid-band XL-MIMO system is expected to significantly enhance throughput and inherently support advanced functionalities such as integrated sensing and communication. Although theoretical studies have highlighted the benefits of mid-band XL-MIMO systems, the promised performance gains have yet to be validated in practical systems, posing a major challenge to the standardization. In this paper, preliminaries are first discussed, followed by an analysis of key challenges in constructing a real-time prototype system. Subsequently, the design and implementation of a real-time mid-band XL-MIMO prototype system are presented. Benefiting from the novel architecture, the proposed prototype system supports metrics aligned with standardization, including a bandwidth of 200 MHz, up to 1024 antenna elements, and up to 256 transceiver chains. Operating in time-division duplexing (TDD) mode, the prototype enables multiuser communication with support for up to 12 users, while retaining standard communication procedures. Built on software-defined radio (SDR) platforms, the system is programmable and allows for flexible deployment of advanced algorithms. Moreover, the modular architecture ensures high scalability, making the system adaptable to various configurations, including distributed deployments and decentralized signal processing. Experimental results with the proposed prototype system demonstrate real-time digital sample processing at 1167.85 Gbps, a peak data throughput of 15.81 Gbps for 12 users, and a maximal spectral efficiency approaching 80 bit/s/Hz.<br>

Existing hallucination detection methods are designed for AR-LLMs and rely on signals from single-step generation, making them ill-suited for D-LLMs where hallucination signals often emerge throughout the multi-step denoising process. To bridge this gap, we propose TraceDet, a novel framework that explicitly leverages the intermediate denoising steps of D-LLMs for hallucination detection. TraceDet models the denoising process as an action trace, with each action defined as the model's prediction over the cleaned response, conditioned on the previous intermediate output. By identifying the sub-trace that is maximally informative to the hallucinated responses, TraceDet leverages the key hallucination signals in the multi-step denoising process of D-LLMs for hallucination detection.

To address this gap, we introduce StereoSync, a novel and efficient model designed to generate audio that is both temporally synchronized with a reference video and spatially aligned with its visual context. Moreover, StereoSync also achieves efficiency by leveraging pretrained foundation models, reducing the need for extensive training while maintaining high-quality synthesis. Unlike existing methods that primarily focus on temporal synchronization, StereoSync introduces a significant advancement by incorporating spatial awareness into video-aligned audio generation. Indeed, given an input video, our approach extracts spatial cues from depth maps and bounding boxes, using them as cross-attention conditioning in a diffusion-based audio generation model. Such an approach allows StereoSync to go beyond simple synchronization, producing stereo audio that dynamically adapts to the spatial structure and movement of a video scene. We evaluate StereoSync on Walking The Maps, a curated dataset comprising videos from video games that feature animated characters walking through diverse environments. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of StereoSync to achieve both temporal and spatial alignment, advancing the state of the art in video-to-audio generation and resulting in a significantly more immersive and realistic audio experience.<br>

However, growing evidence shows that CoT often fail to faithfully represent the underlying reasoning process, raising concerns about their reliability in high-risk applications. Although prior studies have focused on mechanism-level analyses showing that CoTs can be unfaithful, they leave open the practical challenge of deciding whether a specific trajectory is faithful to the internal reasoning of the model. To address this gap, we introduce FaithCoT-Bench, a unified benchmark for instance-level CoT unfaithfulness detection. Our framework establishes a rigorous task formulation that formulates unfaithfulness detection as a discriminative decision problem, and provides FINE-CoT (Faithfulness instance evaluation for Chain-of-Thought), an expert-annotated collection of over 1,000 trajectories generated by four representative LLMs across four domains, including more than 300 unfaithful instances with fine-grained causes and step-level evidence. We further conduct a systematic evaluation of eleven representative detection methods spanning counterfactual, logit-based, and LLM-as-judge paradigms, deriving empirical insights that clarify the strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches and reveal the increased challenges of detection in knowledge-intensive domains and with more advanced models.

Although data-driven approaches using machine learning and deep learning have shown potential, they face challenges such as limited data and distribution shifts caused by varying operating conditions. Domain Adaptation (DA) has emerged as a promising solution, enabling knowledge transfer from source domains with abundant data to target domains with scarce data while mitigating distributional shifts. Given the unique properties of turbofan engines, such as complex operating conditions, high-dimensional sensor data, and slower-changing signals, it is essential to conduct a focused review of DA techniques specifically tailored to turbofan engines. To address this need, this paper provides a comprehensive review of DA solutions for turbofan engine RUL prediction, analyzing key methodologies, challenges, and recent advancements. A novel taxonomy tailored to turbofan engines is introduced, organizing approaches into methodology-based (how DA is applied), alignment-based (where distributional shifts occur due to operational variations), and problem-based (why certain adaptations are needed to address specific challenges). This taxonomy offers a multidimensional view that goes beyond traditional classifications by accounting for the distinctive characteristics of turbofan engine data and the standard process of applying DA techniques to this area. Additionally, we evaluate selected DA techniques on turbofan engine datasets, providing practical insights for practitioners and identifying key challenges. Future research directions are identified to guide the development of more effective DA techniques, advancing the state of RUL prediction for turbofan engines.<br>

Yet their ability to serve as practical assistants for mathematicians, filling in missing steps within complex proofs, remains underexplored. We identify this challenge as the task of subgoal completion, where an LLM must discharge short but nontrivial proof obligations left unresolved in a human-provided sketch. To study this problem, we introduce FormalML, a Lean 4 benchmark built from foundational theories of machine learning. Using a translation tactic that converts procedural proofs into declarative form, we extract 4937 problems spanning optimization and probability inequalities, with varying levels of difficulty. FormalML is the first subgoal completion benchmark to combine premise retrieval and complex research-level contexts.

This critically limits their use in interactive applications such as live content creation and emerging generative world models. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task of frame-level online V2A generation, where a model autoregressively generates audio from video without access to future video frames. Furthermore, we propose SoundReactor, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first simple yet effective framework explicitly tailored for this task. Our design enforces end-to-end causality and targets low per-frame latency with audio-visual synchronization. Our model's backbone is a decoder-only causal transformer over continuous audio latents. For vision conditioning, it leverages grid (patch) features extracted from the smallest variant of the DINOv2 vision encoder, which are aggregated into a single token per frame to maintain end-to-end causality and efficiency. The model is trained through a diffusion pre-training followed by consistency fine-tuning to accelerate the diffusion head decoding. On a benchmark of diverse gameplay videos from AAA titles, our model successfully generates semantically and temporally aligned, high-quality full-band stereo audio, validated by both objective and human evaluations. Furthermore, our model achieves low per-frame waveform-level latency (26.3ms with the head NFE=1, 31.5ms with NFE=4) on 30FPS, 480p videos using a single H100.

However, performance degradation and instability remain significant under sparse-view conditions. In this work, we identify two key failure modes under sparse-view conditions: overfitting in regions with excessive Gaussian density near the camera, and underfitting in distant areas with insufficient Gaussian coverage. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework D$^2$GS, comprising two key components: a Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout strategy that suppresses overfitting by adaptively masking redundant Gaussians based on density and depth, and a Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement module that improves reconstruction quality in under-fitted far-field areas through targeted supervision. Moreover, we introduce a new evaluation metric to quantify the stability of learned Gaussian distributions, providing insights into the robustness of the sparse-view 3DGS. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both visual quality and robustness under sparse view conditions.

We characterize three desiderata for conditional distributional modeling: in-context steerability, valid output space coverage, and distributional alignment, and document across three model families how current post-training can reduce these properties. In particular, we disambiguate between two kinds of in-context learning: ICL for eliciting existing underlying knowledge or capabilities, and in-context steerability, where a model must use in-context information to override its priors and steer to a novel data generating distribution. To better evaluate and improve these desiderata, we introduce Spectrum Suite, a large-scale resource compiled from >40 data sources and spanning >90 tasks requiring models to steer to and match diverse distributions ranging from varied human preferences to numerical distributions and more. We find that while current post-training techniques help elicit underlying capabilities and knowledge, they hurt models' ability to flexibly steer in-context. To mitigate these issues, we propose Spectrum Tuning, a post-training method using Spectrum Suite to improve steerability and distributional coverage. We find that Spectrum Tuning often improves over pretrained models and their instruction-tuned counterparts, enhancing steerability, spanning more of the output space, and improving distributional alignment on held-out datasets.<br>

Recently, language-driven grasp generation has emerged as a promising direction due to its practical interaction capabilities. However, most existing approaches either lack sufficient reasoning and generalization capabilities or depend on complex modular pipelines. Moreover, current grasp foundation models tend to overemphasize dialog and object semantics, resulting in inferior performance and restriction to single-object grasping. To maintain strong reasoning ability and generalization in cluttered environments, we propose VCoT-Grasp, an end-to-end grasp foundation model that incorporates visual chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance visual understanding for grasp generation. VCoT-Grasp adopts a multi-turn processing paradigm that dynamically focuses on visual inputs while providing interpretable reasoning traces. For training, we refine and introduce a large-scale dataset, VCoT-GraspSet, comprising 167K synthetic images with over 1.36M grasps, as well as 400+ real-world images with more than 1.2K grasps, annotated with intermediate bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on both VCoT-GraspSet and real robot demonstrate that our method significantly improves grasp success rates and generalizes effectively to unseen objects, backgrounds, and distractors.

However, traditional MoE systems lack domain-specific constraints essential for medical imaging, where anatomical structure and regional disease heterogeneity strongly influence pathological patterns. Here, we introduce Regional Expert Networks (REN), the first anatomically-informed MoE framework tailored specifically for medical image classification. REN leverages anatomical priors to train seven specialized experts, each dedicated to distinct lung lobes and bilateral lung combinations, enabling precise modeling of region-specific pathological variations. Multi-modal gating mechanisms dynamically integrate radiomics biomarkers and deep learning (DL) features (CNN, ViT, Mamba) to weight expert contributions optimally. Applied to interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification, REN achieves consistently superior performance: the radiomics-guided ensemble reached an average AUC of 0.8646 +/- 0.0467, a +12.5 percent improvement over the SwinUNETR baseline (AUC 0.7685, p = 0.031). Region-specific experts further revealed that lower-lobe models achieved AUCs of 0.88-0.90, surpassing DL counterparts (CNN: 0.76-0.79) and aligning with known disease progression patterns. Through rigorous patient-level cross-validation, REN demonstrates strong generalizability and clinical interpretability, presenting a scalable, anatomically-guided approach readily extensible to other structured medical imaging applications.<br>

However, these models are often influenced by noise such as accidental interactions, leading to suboptimal performance. Therefore, to reduce the effect of noise, some works propose explicitly identifying and removing noisy items. However, we find that simply relying on collaborative information may result in an over-denoising problem, especially for cold items. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework: Interest Alignment for Denoising Sequential Recommendation (IADSR) which integrates both collaborative and semantic information. Specifically, IADSR is comprised of two stages: in the first stage, we obtain the collaborative and semantic embeddings of each item from a traditional sequential recommendation model and an LLM, respectively. In the second stage, we align the collaborative and semantic embeddings and then identify noise in the interaction sequence based on long-term and short-term interests captured in the collaborative and semantic modalities. Our extensive experiments on four public datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and its compatibility with different sequential recommendation systems.<br>

However, their performance often degrades under real-world distribution shifts. Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate this issue by adapting models during inference. Existing methods either rely on computationally expensive backpropagation, which hinders real-time deployment, or focus solely on likelihood adaptation, which overlooks the critical role of the prior. Our prior work, Bayesian Class Adaptation (BCA), addressed these shortcomings for object recognition by introducing a training-free framework that incorporates adaptive priors. Building upon this foundation, we now present Bayesian Class Adaptation plus (BCA+), a unified, training-free framework for TTA for both object recognition and detection. BCA+ introduces a dynamic cache that adaptively stores and updates class embeddings, spatial scales (for detection), and, crucially, adaptive class priors derived from historical predictions. We formulate adaptation as a Bayesian inference problem, where final predictions are generated by fusing the initial VLM output with a cache-based prediction. This cache-based prediction combines a dynamically updated likelihood (measuring feature and scale similarity) and a prior (reflecting the evolving class distribution). This dual-adaptation mechanism, coupled with uncertainty-guided fusion, enables BCA+ to correct both the model's semantic understanding and its contextual confidence. As a training-free method requiring no backpropagation, BCA+ is highly efficient. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both recognition and detection benchmarks.<br>

However, they often suffer from overthinking, meaning generating unnecessarily lengthy reasoning steps for simpler problems. This issue may degrade the efficiency of the models and make them difficult to adapt the reasoning depth to the complexity of problems. To address this, we introduce a novel metric Token Entropy Cumulative Average (TECA), which measures the extent of exploration throughout the reasoning process. We further propose a novel reasoning paradigm -- Explore Briefly, Then Decide -- with an associated Cumulative Entropy Regulation (CER) mechanism. This paradigm leverages TECA to help the model dynamically determine the optimal point to conclude its thought process and provide a final answer, thus achieving efficient reasoning. Experimental results across diverse mathematical benchmarks show that our approach substantially mitigates overthinking without sacrificing problem-solving ability. With our thinking paradigm, the average response length decreases by up to 71% on simpler datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in creating a more efficient and adaptive reasoning process.<br>

This paradigm has shown promise in addressing privacy and safety concerns. However, recent findings reveal that unlearning effects are often fragile: post-unlearning manipulations such as weight quantization or fine-tuning can quickly neutralize the intended forgetting. Prior efforts to improve robustness primarily reformulate unlearning objectives by explicitly assuming the role of vulnerability sources. In this work, we take a different perspective by investigating the role of the optimizer, independent of unlearning objectives and formulations, in shaping unlearning robustness. We show that the 'grade' of the optimizer, defined by the level of information it exploits, ranging from zeroth-order (gradient-free) to first-order (gradient-based) to second-order (Hessian-based), is tightly linked to the resilience of unlearning. Surprisingly, we find that downgrading the optimizer, such as using zeroth-order methods or compressed-gradient variants (e.g., gradient sign-based optimizers), often leads to stronger robustness. While these optimizers produce noisier and less precise updates, they encourage convergence to harder-to-disturb basins in the loss landscape, thereby resisting post-training perturbations. By connecting zeroth-order methods with randomized smoothing, we further highlight their natural advantage for robust unlearning. Motivated by these insights, we propose a hybrid optimizer that combines first-order and zeroth-order updates, preserving unlearning efficacy while enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments on the MUSE and WMDP benchmarks, across multiple LLM unlearning algorithms, validate that our approach achieves more resilient forgetting without sacrificing unlearning quality.<br>

Trained from real interaction data, the simulator predicts future visual observations conditioned on actions, allowing policy rollouts with dense, trajectory-level rewards derived from goal-achieving references. This design delivers an efficient and action-aligned learning signal, drastically lowering sample requirements. With fewer than 400 fine-tuning steps, VLA-RFT surpasses strong supervised baselines and achieves greater efficiency than simulator-based RL.

Existing methods target simple visual disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in actions, instructions, environments, and observations.

We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0 demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing, and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations. Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four modalities.<br>

Models can match memorized content rather than demonstrate true generalization, which inflates scores, distorts cross-model comparisons, and misrepresents progress. We introduce ArenaBencher, a model-agnostic framework for automatic benchmark evolution that updates test cases while preserving comparability. Given an existing benchmark and a diverse pool of models to be evaluated, ArenaBencher infers the core ability of each test case, generates candidate question-answer pairs that preserve the original objective, verifies correctness and intent with an LLM as a judge, and aggregates feedback from multiple models to select candidates that expose shared weaknesses. The process runs iteratively with in-context demonstrations that steer generation toward more challenging and diagnostic cases. We apply ArenaBencher to math problem solving, commonsense reasoning, and safety domains and show that it produces verified, diverse, and fair updates that uncover new failure modes, increase difficulty while preserving test objective alignment, and improve model separability. The framework provides a scalable path to continuously evolve benchmarks in step with the rapid progress of foundation models.<br>

Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of deep hashing models to backdoor attacks. Although these studies have shown promising attack results, they rely on access to the training dataset to implant the backdoor. In the real world, obtaining such data (e.g., identity information) is often prohibited due to privacy protection and intellectual property concerns. Embedding backdoors into deep hashing models without access to the training data, while maintaining retrieval accuracy for the original task, presents a novel and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose DarkHash, the first data-free backdoor attack against deep hashing. Specifically, we design a novel shadow backdoor attack framework with dual-semantic guidance. It embeds backdoor functionality and maintains original retrieval accuracy by fine-tuning only specific layers of the victim model using a surrogate dataset. We consider leveraging the relationship between individual samples and their neighbors to enhance backdoor attacks during training. By designing a topological alignment loss, we optimize both individual and neighboring poisoned samples toward the target sample, further enhancing the attack capability. Experimental results on four image datasets, five model architectures, and two hashing methods demonstrate the high effectiveness of DarkHash, outperforming existing state-of-the-art backdoor attack methods. Defense experiments show that DarkHash can withstand existing mainstream backdoor defense methods.<br>

To highlight this risk, we develop AgentPrint, which achieves an F1-score of 0.866 in agent identification and attains 73.9% and 69.1% top-3 accuracy in user attribute inference for simulated- and real-user settings, respectively.

However, the trajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations in the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally different answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient methods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and formalize as cross-stratum bias-an "apples-to-oranges" comparison of heterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment and hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address this, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage Normalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on their structural properties and computes advantages locally within each stratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true peers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields conditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains the global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard normalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To improve practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly blend SAN with the global estimator. Extensive experiments on diverse single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that Stratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3 points, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more effective search policies. These results establish stratification as a principled remedy for structural heterogeneity in RL for LLM search agents.<br>

Yet aligning LRMs with human preferences, a crucial prerequisite for model deployment, remains underexplored. The statistically correct objective for preference alignment requires marginalizing over reasoning traces, but this computation is intractable in practice. A common workaround optimizes a single sampled trajectory, which introduces substantial gradient variance from stochastic trace sampling. To address this challenge, we frame preference optimization for LRMs through the lens of the bias--variance trade-off and propose Bias--Variance Optimized Preference Optimization (BVPO), a simple, drop-in method that mixes two gradient estimators: a high-variance trace-based estimator and a low-variance empty-trace estimator obtained by disabling reasoning trace generation. Our theory shows that BVPO strictly reduces trace-induced variance for any nontrivial mixture, provides a closed-form choice of the mixing weight that minimizes mean-squared error relative to the true marginal gradient, and under standard smoothness and step-size conditions, tightens classical convergence bounds for stochastic gradient descent. Empirically, BVPO improves alignment over the best baseline by up to 7.8 points on AlpacaEval~2 and 6.8 points on Arena-Hard. Despite being trained only on general conversational data, BVPO also boosts reasoning performance for base models by up to 4.0 points on the average of six math reasoning benchmarks. These results identify variance from trace sampling as a key bottleneck and demonstrate that directly optimizing the bias--variance trade-off yields more stable training and stronger overall performance.<br>

In particular, a state-space model with a scalar-times-identity state matrix is equivalent to a masked self-attention with a $1$-semiseparable causal mask. Consequently, the same sequence transformation (model) has two algorithmic realizations: as a linear-time $O(T)$ recurrence or as a quadratic-time $O(T^2)$ attention. In this note, we formalize and generalize this duality: (i) we extend SSD from the scalar-identity case to general diagonal SSMs (diagonal state matrices); (ii) we show that these diagonal SSMs match the scalar case's training complexity lower bounds while supporting richer dynamics; (iii) we establish a necessary and sufficient condition under which an SSM is equivalent to $1$-semiseparable masked attention; and (iv) we show that such duality fails to extend to standard softmax attention due to rank explosion. Together, these results tighten bridge between recurrent SSMs and Transformers, and widen the design space for expressive yet efficient sequence models.<br>

However, existing defense strategies suffer from limited generalization: they only work on specific attack types or task settings. In this study, we propose Poison-to-Poison (P2P), a general and effective backdoor defense algorithm. P2P injects benign triggers with safe alternative labels into a subset of training samples and fine-tunes the model on this re-poisoned dataset by leveraging prompt-based learning. This enforces the model to associate trigger-induced representations with safe outputs, thereby overriding the effects of original malicious triggers. Thanks to this robust and generalizable trigger-based fine-tuning, P2P is effective across task settings and attack types. Theoretically and empirically, we show that P2P can neutralize malicious backdoors while preserving task performance. We conduct extensive experiments on classification, mathematical reasoning, and summary generation tasks, involving multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. The results demonstrate that our P2P algorithm significantly reduces the attack success rate compared with baseline models. We hope that the P2P can serve as a guideline for defending against backdoor attacks and foster the development of a secure and trustworthy LLM community.<br>

However, because of the LLMs' instruction-following abilities and inability to distinguish the instructions in the data content, such as web pages from search engines, the LLMs are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks. These attacks trick the LLMs into deviating from the original input instruction and executing the attackers' target instruction. Recently, various instruction hierarchy defense strategies are proposed to effectively defend against prompt injection attacks via fine-tuning. In this paper, we explore more vicious attacks that nullify the prompt injection defense methods, even the instruction hierarchy: backdoor-powered prompt injection attacks, where the attackers utilize the backdoor attack for prompt injection attack purposes. Specifically, the attackers poison the supervised fine-tuning samples and insert the backdoor into the model. Once the trigger is activated, the backdoored model executes the injected instruction surrounded by the trigger. We construct a benchmark for comprehensive evaluation. Our experiments demonstrate that backdoor-powered prompt injection attacks are more harmful than previous prompt injection attacks, nullifying existing prompt injection defense methods, even the instruction hierarchy techniques.<br>

Measuring Knowledge-Aware Refusal in Factual Tasks</a></div></span></div><div id='abs'>Abstract:<br><span id='abs'>Large Language Models (LLMs) should refuse to answer questions beyond their knowledge. This capability, which we term knowledge-aware refusal, is crucial for factual reliability. However, existing metrics fail to faithfully measure this ability. On the one hand, simple refusal-based metrics are biased by refusal rates and yield inconsistent scores when models exhibit different refusal tendencies. On the other hand, existing calibration metrics are proxy-based, capturing the performance of auxiliary calibration processes rather than the model's actual refusal behavior. In this work, we propose the Refusal Index (RI), a principled metric that measures how accurately LLMs refuse questions they do not know. We define RI as Spearman's rank correlation between refusal probability and error probability. To make RI practically measurable, we design a lightweight two-pass evaluation method that efficiently estimates RI from observed refusal rates across two standard evaluation runs. Extensive experiments across 16 models and 5 datasets demonstrate that RI accurately quantifies a model's intrinsic knowledge-aware refusal capability in factual tasks. Notably, RI remains stable across different refusal rates and provides consistent model rankings independent of a model's overall accuracy and refusal rates. More importantly, RI provides insight into an important but previously overlooked aspect of LLM factuality: while LLMs achieve high accuracy on factual tasks, their refusal behavior can be unreliable and fragile. This finding highlights the need to complement traditional accuracy metrics with the Refusal Index for comprehensive factuality evaluation.<br>

However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards (e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.<br>

However, their performance in specialized real-world domains often degrades due to challenges in effectively integrating external tools and specific prompting strategies. While methods like agentic reinforcement learning have been proposed to address this, they typically rely on costly parameter updates, for example, through a process that uses Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to alter the output distribution. However, we argue that LLMs can achieve a similar effect on the output distribution by learning experiential knowledge as a token prior, which is a far more lightweight approach that not only addresses practical data scarcity but also avoids the common issue of overfitting. To this end, we propose Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization (Training-Free GRPO), a cost-effective solution that enhances LLM agent performance without any parameter updates. Our method leverages the group relative semantic advantage instead of numerical ones within each group of rollouts, iteratively distilling high-quality experiential knowledge during multi-epoch learning on a minimal ground-truth data. Such knowledge serves as the learned token prior, which is seamlessly integrated during LLM API calls to guide model behavior. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and web searching tasks demonstrate that Training-Free GRPO, when applied to DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus, significantly improves out-of-domain performance. With just a few dozen training samples, Training-Free GRPO outperforms fine-tuned small LLMs with marginal training data and cost.<br>

Meta's DINOv3 extends earlier SSL models through Gram-anchored self-distillation. Whether these design choices improve transfer learning for chest radiography has not been systematically tested. We benchmarked DINOv3 against DINOv2 and ImageNet initialization across seven datasets (n>814,000). Two representative backbones were evaluated: ViT-B/16 and ConvNeXt-B. Images were analyzed at 224x224, 512x512, and 1024x1024 pixels. We additionally assessed frozen features from a 7B model. The primary outcome was mean AUROC across labels. At 224x224, DINOv3 and DINOv2 achieved comparable performance on adult datasets. Increasing resolution to 512x512 yielded consistent improvements for DINOv3 over both DINOv2 and ImageNet. In contrast, results in pediatric cohort showed no differences across initializations. Across all settings, ConvNeXt-B outperformed ViT-B/16. Models using frozen DINOv3-7B features underperformed relative to fully finetuned 86-89M-parameter backbones, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation. Scaling to 1024x1024 did not further improve accuracy. Resolution-related gains were most evident for boundary-dependent and small focal abnormalities. In chest radiography, higher input resolution is critical for leveraging the benefits of modern self-supervised models. 512x512 pixels represent a practical upper limit where DINOv3-initialized ConvNeXt-B networks provide the strongest performance, while larger inputs offer minimal return on cost. Clinically, these findings support use of finetuned, mid-sized backbones at 512x512 for chest radiograph interpretation, with the greatest gains expected in detecting subtle or boundary-centered lesions relevant to emergency and critical care settings.<br>

We perform a sparsification study on several representative MoE models. For each expert, we rank parameters by the magnitude of their activations from the gate projection and progressively prune the activated subset. Pruning up to 60% of parameters within that subset causes only negligible task-performance degradation; substantial drops occur only after more than 90% are removed. We further decompose experts into neuron-granular MoE and visualize their activation values, finding that most neuron activations are near zero. This observation motivates us to select only high-activation neuron experts during pretraining. Based on this insight, we propose Mixture of Neuron Experts (MoNE). MoNE achieves neuron-granular expert selection by only applying a simple top-k selection within each expert, incurs negligible latency, and requires no additional routing parameters or inter-expert communication. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoNE matches traditional MoE performance while activating only 50% of the MoE-layer parameters, and it consistently outperforms traditional MoE when compared at equal numbers of activated parameters. These results suggest that MoNE is a practical approach to improving parameter utilization and inference efficiency in MoE-like models.<br>

In partial multi-label learning, each instance is annotated with a candidate label set, among which only some labels are relevant; in complementary multi-label learning, each instance is annotated with complementary labels indicating the classes to which the instance does not belong. Existing consistent approaches for the two paradigms either require accurate estimation of the generation process of candidate or complementary labels or assume a uniform distribution to eliminate the estimation problem. However, both conditions are usually difficult to satisfy in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose consistent approaches that do not rely on the aforementioned conditions to handle both problems in a unified way. Specifically, we propose two unbiased risk estimators based on first- and second-order strategies. Theoretically, we prove consistency w.r.t. two widely used multi-label classification evaluation metrics and derive convergence rates for the estimation errors of the proposed risk estimators. Empirically, extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches against state-of-the-art methods.<br>

Despite the exponential growth of community interests, researchers are sometimes confused about the direction of their efforts due to minor improvements on standard benchmarks. In this paper, we notice that, unlike image recognition, whose well-acknowledged and realizable goal is 100% accuracy, time series forecasting inherently faces a non-zero error lower bound due to its partially observable and uncertain nature. To pinpoint the research objective and release researchers from saturated tasks, this paper focuses on a fundamental question: how to estimate the performance upper bound of deep time series forecasting? Going beyond classical series-wise predictability metrics, e.g., ADF test, we realize that the forecasting performance is highly related to window-wise properties because of the sequence-to-sequence forecasting paradigm of deep time series models. Based on rigorous statistical tests of over 2,800 newly trained deep forecasters, we discover a significant exponential relationship between the minimum forecasting error of deep models and the complexity of window-wise series patterns, which is termed the accuracy law. The proposed accuracy law successfully guides us to identify saturated tasks from widely used benchmarks and derives an effective training strategy for large time series models, offering valuable insights for future research.<br>

To reduce vulnerability to verifier hacking, many RLVR systems collapse rewards to binary $\{0,1\}$ during training. This choice carries a cost: it introduces \textit{false negatives} (rejecting correct answers, FNs) and \textit{false positives} (accepting incorrect ones, FPs). For instance, a rule-based checker may mark the correct fraction $\frac{12}{36}$ as wrong when compared against the canonical $\frac{1}{3}$ due to brittle parsing/equivalence rules (FN), while a large language model (LLM) judges can be gamed by superficial cues or even a single adversarial token, yielding inflated correctness for wrong solutions (FP). We formalize verifier unreliability by modeling the verifier as a stochastic reward channel with asymmetric noise rates. From this abstraction, we derive two correction algorithms for verifier errors. The first is a \textit{backward} correction that de-biases the observed binary reward to recover an \textit{unbiased} estimator of the clean policy gradient. The second is a \textit{forward} correction that reweights score-function terms so that the expected update direction aligns with the \textit{clean gradient}; notably, it requires only the FN rate. We implement both as lightweight hooks in a group relative policy optimization (GRPO)-based RLVR pipeline and evaluate them on math-reasoning models and benchmarks. Across models and datasets, both corrections improve over uncorrected training; the forward variant converges faster and remains stable under heavier noise. Finally, we show a practical appeal mechanism in which a lightweight LLM verifier estimates the FN rate online by rechecking rule-based negatives, obtaining outperformance compared with other state-of-the-art contenders.<br>

Revealing Its Illusory Success and Fragile Foundation</a></div></span></div><div id='abs'>Abstract:<br><span id='abs'>Large language models (LLMs) inevitably encode outdated or incorrect knowledge. Updating, deleting, and forgetting such knowledge is important for alignment, safety, and other issues. To address this issue, model editing has emerged as a promising paradigm: by precisely editing a small subset of parameters such that a specific fact is updated while preserving other knowledge. Despite its great success reported in previous papers, we find the apparent reliability of editing rests on a fragile foundation and the current literature is largely driven by illusory success. The fundamental goal of steering the model's output toward a target with minimal modification would encourage exploiting hidden shortcuts, rather than utilizing real semantics. This problem directly challenges the feasibility of the current model editing literature at its very foundation, as shortcuts are inherently at odds with robust knowledge integration. Coincidentally, this issue has long been obscured by evaluation frameworks that lack the design of negative examples. To uncover it, we systematically develop a suite of new evaluation methods. Strikingly, we find that state-of-the-art approaches collapse even under the simplest negation queries. Our empirical evidence shows that editing is likely to be based on shortcuts rather than full semantics, calling for an urgent reconsideration of the very basis of model editing before further advancements can be meaningfully pursued.<br>

These errors can propagate misinformation during deployment, leading to both financial and operational harm. Although much research has been devoted to mitigating hallucinations, our understanding of it is still incomplete and fragmented. Without a coherent understanding of hallucinations, proposed solutions risk mitigating surface symptoms rather than underlying causes, limiting their effectiveness and generalizability in deployment. To tackle this gap, we first present a unified, multi-level framework for characterizing both image and text hallucinations across diverse applications, aiming to reduce conceptual fragmentation. We then link these hallucinations to specific mechanisms within a model's lifecycle, using a task-modality interleaved approach to promote a more integrated understanding. Our investigations reveal that hallucinations often stem from predictable patterns in data distributions and inherited biases. By deepening our understanding, this survey provides a foundation for developing more robust and effective solutions to hallucinations in real-world generative AI systems.<br>

This flexible formulation naturally unifies many existing controllable video generation tasks--including first-frame image-to-video, inpainting, extension, and interpolation--under a single, cohesive paradigm. Realizing this vision, however, faces a fundamental obstacle in modern latent video diffusion models: the temporal ambiguity introduced by causal VAEs, where multiple pixel frames are compressed into a single latent representation, making precise frame-level conditioning structurally difficult. We address this challenge with VideoCanvas, a novel framework that adapts the In-Context Conditioning (ICC) paradigm to this fine-grained control task with zero new parameters. We propose a hybrid conditioning strategy that decouples spatial and temporal control: spatial placement is handled via zero-padding, while temporal alignment is achieved through Temporal RoPE Interpolation, which assigns each condition a continuous fractional position within the latent sequence. This resolves the VAE's temporal ambiguity and enables pixel-frame-aware control on a frozen backbone. To evaluate this new capability, we develop VideoCanvasBench, the first benchmark for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, covering both intra-scene fidelity and inter-scene creativity. Experiments demonstrate that VideoCanvas significantly outperforms existing conditioning paradigms, establishing a new state of the art in flexible and unified video generation.<br>

In this work, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modeling to the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurate interpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visual consistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video generation and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and is jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context video editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of generalization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining editing with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a single instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video editing, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image editing data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as green-screening characters or changing materials within a video. Beyond these core capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation, where the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis. To foster future research, we will release our model and code.<br>

As full control of resource allocation is in the hands of the cloud provider and applications only consume resources when they actually perform work, we believe that serverless computing is uniquely positioned to maximize energy efficiency. However, the focus of current serverless platforms is to run hundreds or thousands of serverless functions from different tenants on traditional server hardware, requiring expensive software isolation mechanisms and a high degree of overprovisioning, i.e., idle servers, to anticipate load spikes. With shared caches, high clock frequencies, and many-core architectures, servers today are optimized for large, singular workloads but not to run thousands of isolated functions. We propose rethinking the serverless hardware architecture to align it with the requirements of serverless software. Specifically, we propose using hardware isolation with individual processors per function instead of software isolation resulting in a serverless hardware stack that consumes energy only when an application actually performs work. In preliminary evaluation with real hardware and a typical serverless workload we find that this could reduce energy consumption overheads by 90.63% or an average 70.8MW.<br>

We address this limitation by presenting UniMMVSR, the first unified generative video super-resolution framework to incorporate hybrid-modal conditions, including text, images, and videos. We conduct a comprehensive exploration of condition injection strategies, training schemes, and data mixture techniques within a latent video diffusion model. A key challenge was designing distinct data construction and condition utilization methods to enable the model to precisely utilize all condition types, given their varied correlations with the target video. Our experiments demonstrate that UniMMVSR significantly outperforms existing methods, producing videos with superior detail and a higher degree of conformity to multi-modal conditions.

For instance, repeated sampling has been shown to increase their capabilities, such as solving difficult math and coding problems, but it has also been shown to increase their potential for harm, such as being jailbroken. Such results raise a crucial question for both capability and safety forecasting: how can one accurately predict a model's behavior when scaled to a massive number of attempts, given a vastly smaller sampling budget? This question is directly relevant to model providers, who serve hundreds of millions of users daily, and to governmental regulators, who seek to prevent harms. To answer this questions, we make three contributions. First, we find that standard methods for fitting these laws suffer from statistical shortcomings that hinder predictive accuracy, especially in data-limited scenarios. Second, we remedy these shortcomings by introducing a robust estimation framework, which uses a beta-binomial distribution to generate more accurate predictions from limited data. Third, we propose a dynamic sampling strategy that allocates a greater budget to harder problems. Combined, these innovations enable more reliable prediction of rare risks and capabilities at a fraction of the computational cost.<br>

Existing methods estimate the distribution in open environments using seen-class data, where the absence of unseen classes makes the estimation error inherently unidentifiable. Intuitively, learning beyond the seen classes is crucial for distribution estimation to bound the estimation error. We theoretically demonstrate that the distribution can be effectively estimated by generating unseen-class data, through which the estimation error is upper-bounded. Building on this theoretical insight, we propose a novel open-vocabulary learning method, which generates unseen-class data for estimating the distribution in open environments. The method consists of a class-domain-wise data generation pipeline and a distribution alignment algorithm. The data generation pipeline generates unseen-class data under the guidance of a hierarchical semantic tree and domain information inferred from the seen-class data, facilitating accurate distribution estimation. With the generated data, the distribution alignment algorithm estimates and maximizes the posterior probability to enhance generalization in open-vocabulary learning. Extensive experiments on $11$ datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline approaches by up to $14\%$, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority.<br>

To address this gap, we introduce MedQ-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that establishes a perception-reasoning paradigm for language-based evaluation of medical image quality with Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MedQ-Bench defines two complementary tasks: (1) MedQ-Perception, which probes low-level perceptual capability via human-curated questions on fundamental visual attributes; and (2) MedQ-Reasoning, encompassing both no-reference and comparison reasoning tasks, aligning model evaluation with human-like reasoning on image quality. The benchmark spans five imaging modalities and over forty quality attributes, totaling 2,600 perceptual queries and 708 reasoning assessments, covering diverse image sources including authentic clinical acquisitions, images with simulated degradations via physics-based reconstructions, and AI-generated images. To evaluate reasoning ability, we propose a multi-dimensional judging protocol that assesses model outputs along four complementary axes. We further conduct rigorous human-AI alignment validation by comparing LLM-based judgement with radiologists. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrates that models exhibit preliminary but unstable perceptual and reasoning skills, with insufficient accuracy for reliable clinical use. These findings highlight the need for targeted optimization of MLLMs in medical IQA.

Existing defenses fall into two lines: (i) self-verification that asks each agent to pre-filter unsafe instructions before execution, and (ii) external guard modules that police behaviors. The former often underperforms because a standalone agent lacks sufficient capacity to detect cross-agent unsafe chains and delegation-induced risks; the latter increases system overhead and creates a single-point-of-failure-once compromised, system-wide safety collapses, and adding more guards worsens cost and complexity. To solve these challenges, we propose AdvEvo-MARL, a co-evolutionary multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that internalizes safety into task agents. Rather than relying on external guards, AdvEvo-MARL jointly optimizes attackers (which synthesize evolving jailbreak prompts) and defenders (task agents trained to both accomplish their duties and resist attacks) in adversarial learning environments. To stabilize learning and foster cooperation, we introduce a public baseline for advantage estimation: agents within the same functional group share a group-level mean-return baseline, enabling lower-variance updates and stronger intra-group coordination. Across representative attack scenarios, AdvEvo-MARL consistently keeps attack-success rate (ASR) below 20%, whereas baselines reach up to 38.33%, while preserving-and sometimes improving-task accuracy (up to +3.67% on reasoning tasks). These results show that safety and utility can be jointly improved without relying on extra guard agents or added system overhead.<br>

However, a pair of recent studies reported being unable to successfully transfer image jailbreaks between vision-language models (VLMs). To explain this striking difference, we propose a fundamental distinction regarding the transferability of attacks against machine learning models: attacks in the input data-space can transfer, whereas attacks in model representation space do not, at least not without geometric alignment of representations. We then provide theoretical and empirical evidence of this hypothesis in four different settings. First, we mathematically prove this distinction in a simple setting where two networks compute the same input-output map but via different representations. Second, we construct representation-space attacks against image classifiers that are as successful as well-known data-space attacks, but fail to transfer. Third, we construct representation-space attacks against LMs that successfully jailbreak the attacked models but again fail to transfer. Fourth, we construct data-space attacks against VLMs that successfully transfer to new VLMs, and we show that representation space attacks can transfer when VLMs' latent geometries are sufficiently aligned in post-projector space. Our work reveals that adversarial transfer is not an inherent property of all attacks but contingent on their operational domain - the shared data-space versus models' unique representation spaces - a critical insight for building more robust models.<br>

Our diagnostic analysis reveals three fundamental weaknesses in state-of-the-art AVR approaches: (1) limited cross-repository generalization, with performance drops on unseen codebases; (2) inability to capture long-range dependencies, causing a performance degradation on complex, multi-hunk repairs; and (3) over-reliance on superficial lexical patterns, leading to significant performance drops on vulnerabilities with minor syntactic variations like variable renaming. To address these limitations, we propose SeCuRepair, a semantics-aligned, curriculum-driven, and reasoning-enhanced framework for vulnerability repair. At its core, SeCuRepair adopts a reason-then-edit paradigm, requiring the model to articulate why and how a vulnerability should be fixed before generating the patch. This explicit reasoning enforces a genuine understanding of repair logic rather than superficial memorization of lexical patterns. SeCuRepair also moves beyond traditional supervised fine-tuning and employs semantics-aware reinforcement learning, rewarding patches for their syntactic and semantic alignment with the oracle patch rather than mere token overlap. Complementing this, a difficulty-aware curriculum progressively trains the model, starting with simple fixes and advancing to complex, multi-hunk coordinated edits. We evaluate SeCuRepair on strict, repository-level splits of BigVul and newly crafted PrimeVul_AVR datasets. SeCuRepair significantly outperforms all baselines, surpassing the best-performing baselines by 34.52% on BigVul and 31.52% on PrimeVul\textsubscript{AVR} in terms of CodeBLEU, respectively. Comprehensive ablation studies further confirm that each component of our framework contributes to its final performance.<br>

However, they also face the inefficiency challenge as they process long sequences of high-resolution screenshots and solving long-horizon tasks, making inference slow, costly and memory-bound. While key-value (KV) caching can mitigate this, storing the full cache is prohibitive for image-heavy contexts. Existing cache-compression methods are sub-optimal as they do not account for the spatial and temporal redundancy of GUIs. In this work, we first analyze attention patterns in GUI agent workloads and find that, unlike in natural images, attention sparsity is uniformly high across all transformer layers. This insight motivates a simple uniform budget allocation strategy, which we show empirically outperforms more complex layer-varying schemes. Building on this, we introduce GUI-KV, a plug-and-play KV cache compression method for GUI agents that requires no retraining. GUI-KV combines two novel techniques: (i) spatial saliency guidance, which augments attention scores with the L2 norm of hidden states to better preserve semantically important visual tokens, and (ii) temporal redundancy scoring, which projects previous frames' keys onto the current frame's key subspace to preferentially prune redundant history. Across standard GUI agent benchmarks and models, GUI-KV outperforms competitive KV compression baselines, closely matching full-cache accuracy at modest budgets. Notably, in a 5-screenshot setting on the AgentNetBench benchmark, GUI-KV reduces decoding FLOPs by 38.9% while increasing step accuracy by 4.1% over the full-cache baseline. These results demonstrate that exploiting GUI-specific redundancies enables efficient and reliable agent performance.<br>

In parallel, the long-standing notion of AI agents, defined by the sensing-decision-action loop, is entering a new paradigm: with FMs as their cognitive core, agents transcend rule-based behaviors to achieve autonomy, generalization, and self-reflection. This dual shift is reinforced by real-world demands such as autonomous driving, robotics, virtual assistants, and GUI agents, as well as ecosystem advances in embedded hardware, edge computing, mobile deployment platforms, and communication protocols that together enable large-scale deployment. Yet this convergence collides with reality: while applications demand long-term adaptability and real-time interaction, mobile and edge deployments remain constrained by memory, energy, bandwidth, and latency. This creates a fundamental tension between the growing complexity of FMs and the limited resources of deployment environments. This survey provides the first systematic characterization of adaptive, resource-efficient agentic AI systems. We summarize enabling techniques into elastic inference, test-time adaptation, dynamic multimodal integration, and agentic AI applications, and identify open challenges in balancing accuracy-latency-communication trade-offs and sustaining robustness under distribution shifts. We further highlight future opportunities in algorithm-system co-design, cognitive adaptation, and collaborative edge deployment. By mapping FM structures, cognition, and hardware resources, this work establishes a unified perspective toward scalable, adaptive, and resource-efficient agentic AI. We believe this survey can help readers to understand the connections between enabling technologies while promoting further discussions on the fusion of agentic intelligence and intelligent agents.<br>

Such a setting can address the concerns on data privacy and security issues of medical images. However, current source-free domain adaptation frameworks mainly focus on the pseudo label refinement for target data without the consideration of learning procedure. Indeed, a progressive learning process from source to target domain will benefit the knowledge transfer during model adaptation. To this end, we propose a curriculum-based framework, namely learning from curriculum (LFC), for source-free domain adaptation, which consists of easy-to-hard and source-to-target curricula. Concretely, the former curriculum enables the framework to start learning with `easy' samples and gradually tune the optimization direction of model adaption by increasing the sample difficulty. While, the latter can stablize the adaptation process, which ensures smooth transfer of the model from the source domain to the target. We evaluate the proposed source-free domain adaptation approach on the public cross-domain datasets for fundus segmentation and polyp segmentation. The extensive experimental results show that our framework surpasses the existing approaches and achieves a new state-of-the-art.<br>

While recent studies leverage visual or textual prompts to guide this process, they often rely on point cloud encoders as generic feature extractors, overlooking the intrinsic challenges of 3D data such as sparsity, noise, and geometric ambiguity. As a result, 3D features learned in isolation frequently lack clear and semantically consistent functional boundaries. To address this bottleneck, we propose a semantic-grounded learning paradigm that transfers rich semantic knowledge from large-scale 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) into the 3D domain. Specifically, We introduce Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT), a pre-training strategy that aligns a 3D encoder with lifted 2D semantics and jointly optimizes reconstruction, affinity, and diversity to yield semantically organized representations. Building on this backbone, we further design the Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST), which integrates multi-modal prompts with CMAT-pretrained features to generate precise, prompt-aware segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our framework establishes new state-of-the-art results for 3D affordance segmentation.<br>

However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept, making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit, computable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous tool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We deploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user base. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by 0.27%.<br>

Baked appearance and shadow information in GS radiance fields cause inconsistencies when combining objects and scenes. Addressing this requires relightable object reconstruction and scene lighting estimation. For relightable object reconstruction, existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods often rely on ray tracing, leading to low efficiency. We introduce Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs), which store lighting and occlusion information and allow efficient 3D querying via interpolation, avoiding expensive ray tracing. SOPs provide at least a 2x speedup in reconstruction and enable real-time shadow computation in Gaussian scenes. For lighting estimation, existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods struggle to model intricate light transport and often fail in complex scenes, while learning-based methods predict lighting from a single image and are viewpoint-sensitive. We observe that 3D object-scene composition primarily concerns the object's appearance and nearby shadows. Thus, we simplify the challenging task of full scene lighting estimation by focusing on the environment lighting at the object's placement. Specifically, we capture a 360 degrees reconstructed radiance field of the scene at the location and fine-tune a diffusion model to complete the lighting. Building on these advances, we propose ComGS, a novel 3D object-scene composition framework. Our method achieves high-quality, real-time rendering at around 28 FPS, produces visually harmonious results with vivid shadows, and requires only 36 seconds for editing.

Most existing work has focused on single-stream approaches that model the spatio-temporal aspects of frame sequences. However, recent research has shifted toward two-stream methods that learn action-wise features to enhance action segmentation performance. In this work, we propose the Dual-Stream Alignment Network (DSA Net) and investigate the impact of incorporating a second stream of learned action features to guide segmentation by capturing both action and action-transition cues. Communication between the two streams is facilitated by a Temporal Context (TC) block, which fuses complementary information using cross-attention and Quantum-based Action-Guided Modulation (Q-ActGM), enhancing the expressive power of the fused features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning framework for action segmentation. Our primary objective is for the two streams (frame-wise and action-wise) to learn a shared feature space through feature alignment. This is encouraged by the proposed Dual-Stream Alignment Loss, which comprises three components: relational consistency, cross-level contrastive, and cycle-consistency reconstruction losses. Following prior work, we evaluate DSA Net on several diverse benchmark datasets: GTEA, Breakfast, 50Salads, and EgoProcel.

To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework that tightly integrates three key components: (1) Terrain-Aware Locomotion Policy with a Blind Backbone, which leverages pre-trained elevation map-based perception to guide reinforcement learning with minimal visual input; (2) Multi-Modality Cross-Attention Transformer, which reconstructs structured terrain representations from noisy depth images; (3) Realistic Depth Images Synthetic Method, which employs self-occlusion-aware ray casting and noise-aware modeling to synthesize realistic depth observations, achieving over 30\% reduction in terrain reconstruction error.

Among these techniques, Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) has been shown to improve both the learning capacity and training stability of the vanilla Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method by explicitly decomposing pre-trained weights into magnitude and directional components. In this work, we propose DoRAN, a new variant of DoRA designed to further stabilize training and boost the sample efficiency of DoRA. Our approach includes two key stages: (i) injecting noise into the denominator of DoRA's weight decomposition, which serves as an adaptive regularizer to mitigate instabilities; and (ii) replacing static low-rank matrices with auxiliary networks that generate them dynamically, enabling parameter coupling across layers and yielding better sample efficiency in both theory and practice. Comprehensive experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that DoRAN consistently outperforms LoRA, DoRA, and other PEFT baselines.

By coupling their adaptation through a shared generator, HoRA encourages cross-head information sharing, and thus directly addresses the aforementioned limitation of LoRA. By comparing LoRA and HoRA through the lens of hierarchical mixture of experts, our theoretical findings reveal that the latter achieves superior sample efficiency to the former. Furthermore, through extensive experiments across diverse language and vision benchmarks, we demonstrate that HoRA outperforms LoRA and other PEFT methods while requiring only a marginal increase in the number of trainable parameters.<br>

These pipelines typically follow an encode--diffuse--decode three-stage architecture. Current serving systems deploy diffusion pipelines within a static, manual, and pipeline-level paradigm, allocating the same resources to every request and stage. However, through an in-depth analysis, we find that such a paradigm is inefficient due to the discrepancy in resource needs across the three stages of each request, as well as across different requests. Following the analysis, we propose the dynamic stage-level serving paradigm and develop TridentServe, a brand new diffusion serving system. TridentServe automatically, dynamically derives the placement plan (i.e., how each stage resides) for pipeline deployment and the dispatch plan (i.e., how the requests are routed) for request processing, co-optimizing the resource allocation for both model and requests. Extensive experiments show that TridentServe consistently improves SLO attainment and reduces average/P95 latencies by up to 2.5x and 3.6x/4.1x over existing works across a variety of workloads.<br>

While these advancements have streamlined complex workflows, they have also introduced critical safety and security risks. Current static safety benchmarks and red-teaming tools are inadequate for identifying emerging real-world risky scenarios, as they fail to cover certain boundary conditions, such as the combined effects of different jailbreak tools. In this work, we propose RedCodeAgent, the first automated red-teaming agent designed to systematically uncover vulnerabilities in diverse code agents. With an adaptive memory module, RedCodeAgent can leverage existing jailbreak knowledge, dynamically select the most effective red-teaming tools and tool combinations in a tailored toolbox for a given input query, thus identifying vulnerabilities that might otherwise be overlooked. For reliable evaluation, we develop simulated sandbox environments to additionally evaluate the execution results of code agents, mitigating potential biases of LLM-based judges that only rely on static code. Through extensive evaluations across multiple state-of-the-art code agents, diverse risky scenarios, and various programming languages, RedCodeAgent consistently outperforms existing red-teaming methods, achieving higher attack success rates and lower rejection rates with high efficiency. We further validate RedCodeAgent on real-world code assistants, e.g., Cursor and Codeium, exposing previously unidentified security risks. By automating and optimizing red-teaming processes, RedCodeAgent enables scalable, adaptive, and effective safety assessments of code agents.<br>

Improving Diffusion-based or Flow-based Robot Policies via Test-time Distribution-level Composition</a></div></span></div><div id='abs'>Abstract:<br><span id='abs'>Diffusion-based models for robotic control, including vision-language-action (VLA) and vision-action (VA) policies, have demonstrated significant capabilities. Yet their advancement is constrained by the high cost of acquiring large-scale interaction datasets. This work introduces an alternative paradigm for enhancing policy performance without additional model training. Perhaps surprisingly, we demonstrate that the composed policies can exceed the performance of either parent policy. Our contribution is threefold. First, we establish a theoretical foundation showing that the convex composition of distributional scores from multiple diffusion models can yield a superior one-step functional objective compared to any individual score. A Grönwall-type bound is then used to show that this single-step improvement propagates through entire generation trajectories, leading to systemic performance gains. Second, motivated by these results, we propose General Policy Composition (GPC), a training-free method that enhances performance by combining the distributional scores of multiple pre-trained policies via a convex combination and test-time search. GPC is versatile, allowing for the plug-and-play composition of heterogeneous policies, including VA and VLA models, as well as those based on diffusion or flow-matching, irrespective of their input visual modalities. Third, we provide extensive empirical validation. Experiments on Robomimic, PushT, and RoboTwin benchmarks, alongside real-world robotic evaluations, confirm that GPC consistently improves performance and adaptability across a diverse set of tasks. Further analysis of alternative composition operators and weighting strategies offers insights into the mechanisms underlying the success of GPC. These results establish GPC as a simple yet effective method for improving control performance by leveraging existing policies.<br>

We propose a simple parameter-space correction: in a source domain containing both real and pseudo-labeled data, two ASR models are fine-tuned from the same initialization, one on ground-truth labels and the other on pseudo-labels, and their weight difference forms a correction vector that captures pseudo-label biases. When applied to a pseudo-labeled target model, this vector enhances recognition, achieving up to a 35% relative Word Error Rate (WER) reduction on AfriSpeech-200 across ten African accents with the Whisper tiny model.<br>

Current MLE benchmarks suffer from low scalability and limited applicability because they rely on static, manually curated tasks, demanding extensive time and manual effort to produce. We introduce MLE-Smith, a fully automated multi-agent pipeline, to transform raw datasets into competition-style MLE challenges through an efficient generate-verify-execute paradigm for scaling MLE tasks with verifiable quality, real-world usability, and rich diversity. The proposed multi-agent pipeline in MLE-Smith drives structured task design and standardized refactoring, coupled with a hybrid verification mechanism that enforces strict structural rules and high-level semantic soundness. It further validates empirical solvability and real-world fidelity through interactive execution. We apply MLE-Smith to 224 of real-world datasets and generate 606 tasks spanning multiple categories, objectives, and modalities, demonstrating that MLE-Smith can work effectively across a wide range of real-world datasets.

However, applying extended reasoning to every step introduces substantial redundancy, as sub-problems vary widely in difficulty and complexity: a small number of pivotal steps are genuinely challenging and decisive for the final answer, while many others only involve straightforward revisions or simple computations. Therefore, a natural idea is to endow reasoning models with the ability to adaptively respond to this variation, rather than treating all steps with the same level of elaboration. To this end, we propose MixReasoning, a framework that dynamically adjusts the depth of reasoning within a single response. The resulting chain of thought then becomes a mixture of detailed reasoning on difficult steps and concise inference on simpler ones. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME show that MixReasoning shortens reasoning length and substantially improves efficiency without compromising accuracy.<br>

Second, Gemini Robotics 1.5 interleaves actions with a multi-level internal reasoning process in natural language. This enables the robot to "think before acting" and notably improves its ability to decompose and execute complex, multi-step tasks, and also makes the robot's behavior more interpretable to the user. Third, Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 establishes a new state-of-the-art for embodied reasoning, i.e., for reasoning capabilities that are critical for robots, such as visual and spatial understanding, task planning, and progress estimation.

Existing MTS anomaly detection methods fall into three categories: reconstruction-based, prediction-based, and classifier-based methods. However, these methods face two key challenges: (1) Unsupervised learning methods, such as reconstruction-based and prediction-based methods, rely on error thresholds, which can lead to inaccuracies; (2) Semi-supervised methods mainly model normal data and often underuse anomaly labels, limiting detection of subtle anomalies;(3) Supervised learning methods, such as classifier-based approaches, often fail to capture local relationships, incur high computational costs, and are constrained by the scarcity of labeled data. To address these limitations, we propose Moon, a supervised modality conversion-based multivariate time series anomaly detection framework. Moon enhances the efficiency and accuracy of anomaly detection while providing detailed anomaly analysis reports. First, Moon introduces a novel multivariate Markov Transition Field (MV-MTF) technique to convert numeric time series data into image representations, capturing relationships across variables and timestamps. Since numeric data retains unique patterns that cannot be fully captured by image conversion alone, Moon employs a Multimodal-CNN to integrate numeric and image data through a feature fusion model with parameter sharing, enhancing training efficiency. Finally, a SHAP-based anomaly explainer identifies key variables contributing to anomalies, improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on six real-world MTS datasets demonstrate that Moon outperforms six state-of-the-art methods by up to 93% in efficiency, 4% in accuracy and, 10.8% in interpretation performance.<br>

Moreover, existing techniques rarely assess whether a training sample provides novel information or is redundant with the knowledge already acquired by the model, resulting in unnecessary costs. In this work, we explore a new test-time self-improvement method to create more effective and generalizable agentic LMs on-the-fly. The proposed algorithm can be summarized in three steps: (i) first it identifies the samples that model struggles with (self-awareness), (ii) then generates similar examples from detected uncertain samples (self-data augmentation), and (iii) uses these newly generated samples at test-time fine-tuning (self-improvement). We study two variants of this approach: Test-Time Self-Improvement (TT-SI), where the same model generates additional training examples from its own uncertain cases and then learns from them, and contrast this approach with Test-Time Distillation (TT-D), where a stronger model generates similar examples for uncertain cases, enabling student to adapt using distilled supervision. Empirical evaluations across different agent benchmarks demonstrate that TT-SI improves the performance with +5.48% absolute accuracy gain on average across all benchmarks and surpasses other standard learning methods, yet using 68x less training samples. Our findings highlight the promise of TT-SI, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement algorithms at test-time as a new paradigm for building more capable agents toward self-evolution.<br>

However, designing an optimal topology is a non-trivial challenge, as it requires balancing competing objectives such as task performance, communication cost, and robustness. Existing frameworks often rely on static or hand-crafted topologies, which inherently fail to adapt to diverse task requirements, leading to either excessive token consumption for simple problems or performance bottlenecks for complex ones. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel generative framework called \textit{Guided Topology Diffusion (GTD)}. Inspired by conditional discrete graph diffusion models, GTD formulates topology synthesis as an iterative construction process. At each step, the generation is steered by a lightweight proxy model that predicts multi-objective rewards (e.g., accuracy, utility, cost), enabling real-time, gradient-free optimization towards task-adaptive topologies. This iterative, guided synthesis process distinguishes GTD from single-step generative frameworks, enabling it to better navigate complex design trade-offs. We validated GTD across multiple benchmarks, and experiments show that this framework can generate highly task-adaptive, sparse, and efficient communication topologies, significantly outperforming existing methods in LLM agent collaboration.<br>

Existing work has studied pretraining poisoning assuming adversaries control a percentage of the training corpus. However, for large models, even small percentages translate to impractically large amounts of data. This work demonstrates for the first time that poisoning attacks instead require a near-constant number of documents regardless of dataset size. We conduct the largest pretraining poisoning experiments to date, pretraining models from 600M to 13B parameters on chinchilla-optimal datasets (6B to 260B tokens). We find that 250 poisoned documents similarly compromise models across all model and dataset sizes, despite the largest models training on more than 20 times more clean data. We also run smaller-scale experiments to ablate factors that could influence attack success, including broader ratios of poisoned to clean data and non-random distributions of poisoned samples. Finally, we demonstrate the same dynamics for poisoning during fine-tuning. Altogether, our results suggest that injecting backdoors through data poisoning may be easier for large models than previously believed as the number of poisons required does not scale up with model size, highlighting the need for more research on defences to mitigate this risk in future models.<br>

Although graph-based methods offer greater representational adaptability, they are frequently impeded by excessive computational complexity. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes the Heterogeneous Subgraph Network (HSNet), a novel framework that efficiently leverages graph modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. The core idea of HSNet is to decompose the global graph into manageable sub-components. First, we introduce the Constructive Subgraph Set Block (CSSB), which generates a diverse set of complementary subgraphs. Rather than relying on a single monolithic graph, CSSB captures heterogeneous characteristics of the image by modeling different relational patterns and feature interactions, producing a rich ensemble of both local and global graph structures. Subsequently, the Subgraph Aggregation Block (SAB) integrates the representations embedded across these subgraphs. Through adaptive weighting and fusion of multi-graph features, SAB constructs a comprehensive and discriminative representation that captures intricate interdependencies. Furthermore, a Node Sampling Strategy (NSS) is designed to selectively retain the most salient features, thereby enhancing accuracy while reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively balancing reconstruction quality with computational efficiency. The code will be made publicly available.<br>

Model selection thus entails a critical trade-off between performance and cost: high-performing LLMs typically incur substantial expenses, whereas budget-friendly small language models (SLMs) are constrained by limited capabilities. Current research primarily proposes two routing strategies: pre-generation routing and cascade routing. Both approaches have distinct characteristics, with cascade routing typically offering superior cost-effectiveness and accuracy despite its higher latency. To further address the limitations of both approaches, we introduce SATER, a dual-mode compatible approach that fine-tunes models through shortest-response preference optimization and a confidence-aware rejection mechanism. SATER significantly reduces redundant outputs and response times, while improving both the performance of pre-generation routing and the efficiency of cascade routing. Experiments across three SLMs and six datasets, varying in type and complexity, demonstrate that SATER achieves comparable performance while consistently reducing computational costs by over 50\% and cascade latency by over 80\%.<br>

In this work, we uncover an interesting property of these models: dLLMs trained on textual data implicitly learn a mixture of semi-autoregressive experts, where different generation orders reveal different specialized behaviors. We show that committing to any single, fixed inference time schedule, a common practice, collapses performance by failing to leverage this latent ensemble. To address this, we introduce HEX (Hidden semiautoregressive EXperts for test-time scaling), a training-free inference method that ensembles across heterogeneous block schedules. By doing a majority vote over diverse block-sized generation paths, HEX robustly avoids failure modes associated with any single fixed schedule. On reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K, it boosts accuracy by up to 3.56X (from 24.72% to 88.10%), outperforming top-K margin inference and specialized fine-tuned methods like GRPO, without additional training. HEX even yields significant gains on MATH benchmark from 16.40% to 40.00%, scientific reasoning on ARC-C from 54.18% to 87.80%, and TruthfulQA from 28.36% to 57.46%.

However, current GFMs are challenged by the extreme heterogeneity of graph data, where each graph can possess a unique feature space, label set, and topology. To address this, two main paradigms have emerged. The first leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), but is fundamentally text-dependent, thus struggles to handle the numerical features in vast graphs. The second pre-trains a structure-based model, but the adaptation to new tasks typically requires a costly, per-graph tuning stage, creating a critical efficiency bottleneck. In this work, we move beyond these limitations and introduce \textbf{G}raph \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{L}earning \textbf{T}ransformer (GILT), a framework built on an LLM-free and tuning-free architecture. GILT introduces a novel token-based framework for in-context learning (ICL) on graphs, reframing classification tasks spanning node, edge and graph levels in a unified framework. This mechanism is the key to handling heterogeneity, as it is designed to operate on generic numerical features. Further, its ability to understand class semantics dynamically from the context enables tuning-free adaptation. Comprehensive experiments show that GILT achieves stronger few-shot performance with significantly less time than LLM-based or tuning-based baselines, validating the effectiveness of our approach.<br>

While multi-LLM systems produce more diverse responses than single models and thus have greater potential, they often underperform compared to single LLM self-consistency.

However, existing approaches to online claim verification, which requires iterative evidence retrieval and reasoning, still mainly rely on prompt engineering or pre-designed reasoning workflows, without unified training to improve necessary skills. Therefore, we introduce Veri-R1, an online reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables an LLM to interact with a search engine and to receive reward signals that explicitly shape its planning, retrieval, and reasoning behaviors. This dynamic interaction of LLM with retrieval systems more accurately reflects real-world verification scenarios and fosters comprehensive verification skills. Empirical results show that Veri-R1 improves joint accuracy by up to 30% and doubles the evidence score, often surpassing its larger-scale model counterparts. Ablation studies further reveal the impact of reward components, and the link between output logits and label accuracy.

This alignment typically requires fine-tuning, which is computationally demanding. Recently, inference-time alignment via noise optimization has emerged as an efficient alternative, modifying initial input noise to steer the diffusion denoising process towards generating high-reward images. However, this approach suffers from reward hacking, where the model produces images that score highly, yet deviate significantly from the original prompt. We show that noise-space regularization is insufficient and that preventing reward hacking requires an explicit image-space constraint. To this end, we propose MIRA (MItigating Reward hAcking), a training-free, inference-time alignment method. MIRA introduces an image-space, score-based KL surrogate that regularizes the sampling trajectory with a frozen backbone, constraining the output distribution so reward can increase without off-distribution drift (reward hacking). We derive a tractable approximation to KL using diffusion scores. Across SDv1.5 and SDXL, multiple rewards (Aesthetic, HPSv2, PickScore), and public datasets (e.g., Animal-Animal, HPDv2), MIRA achieves >60\% win rate vs. strong baselines while preserving prompt adherence; mechanism plots show reward gains with near-zero drift, whereas DNO drifts as compute increases. We further introduce MIRA-DPO, mapping preference optimization to inference time with a frozen backbone, extending MIRA to non-differentiable rewards without fine-tuning.<br>

However, these models often lack round-trip consistency. For instance, a state-of-the-art chemical LLM may successfully caption a molecule, yet be unable to accurately reconstruct the original structure from its own generated text. This inconsistency suggests that models are learning unidirectional memorization rather than flexible mastery. Indeed, recent work has demonstrated a strong correlation between a model's round-trip consistency and its performance on the primary tasks. This strong correlation reframes consistency into a direct target for model improvement. We therefore introduce Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL), a novel framework that trains a model to improve its consistency by using the success of a round-trip transformation as a reward signal. We further propose an iterative variant where forward and reverse mappings alternately train each other in a self-improvement loop, a process that is highly data-efficient and notably effective with the massive amount of unlabelled data common in chemistry. Experiments demonstrate that RTRL significantly \textbf{boosts performance and consistency} over strong baselines across supervised, self-supervised, and synthetic data regimes.

We posit that an elastic-native training system must jointly deliver (i) parameter consistency, (ii) low mean time to recovery (MTTR), (iii) high post-change throughput, and (iv) computation consistency. No prior system achieves all four simultaneously. To achieve these goals, we present ElasWave, which delivers per-step fault tolerance via multi-dimensional scheduling across graph, dataflow, DVFS, and RNG. ElasWave reshapes and reshards micro-batches while preserving the global batch size and gradient scale. It performs online pipeline resharding with asynchronous parameter migration and interleaves ZeRO partitions, reducing parameter recovery processes to disjoint rank-to-rank transfers. It further leverages DVFS to absorb pipeline bubbles and reshards RNG to keep computation consistency. Together, a dynamic communicator enables in-place communication group edits, while per-step in-memory snapshots support online verification and redistribution. We evaluate ElasWave on 96 NPUs and benchmark it against state-of-the-art baselines: throughput improves by $1.35\times$ over ReCycle and $1.60\times$ over TorchFT; communicator recovery completes within one second (up to $82\times/3.6\times$ faster than full/partial rebuilds); migration MTTR drops by as much as $51\%$; and convergence deviation is reduced by approximately $78\%$.<br>

This helps us to understand the new world in a compositional manner and facilitates extrapolation, as objects naturally consist of multiple concepts. In this work, we argue that the cognitive mechanism of comparison, fundamental to human learning, is also vital for machines to recover true concepts underlying the data. This offers correctness guarantees for the field of concept learning, which, despite its impressive empirical successes, still lacks general theoretical support. Specifically, we aim to develop a theoretical framework for the identifiability of concepts with multiple classes of observations. We show that with sufficient diversity across classes, hidden concepts can be identified without assuming specific concept types, functional relations, or parametric generative models. Interestingly, even when conditions are not globally satisfied, we can still provide alternative guarantees for as many concepts as possible based on local comparisons, thereby extending the applicability of our theory to more flexible scenarios. Moreover, the hidden structure between classes and concepts can also be identified nonparametrically. We validate our theoretical results in both synthetic and real-world settings.<br>

However, most systems exhibit a "profit mirage": dazzling back-tested returns evaporate once the model's knowledge window ends, because of the inherent information leakage in LLMs. In this paper, we systematically quantify this leakage issue across four dimensions and release FinLake-Bench, a leakage-robust evaluation benchmark. Furthermore, to mitigate this issue, we introduce FactFin, a framework that applies counterfactual perturbations to compel LLM-based agents to learn causal drivers instead of memorized outcomes. FactFin integrates four core components: Strategy Code Generator, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Monte Carlo Tree Search, and Counterfactual Simulator. Extensive experiments show that our method surpasses all baselines in out-of-sample generalization, delivering superior risk-adjusted performance.<br>

The likelihood of these detections is indicated by scores in [0, 1]. Lifting these scores to temporal properties over sequences can be useful for several downstream applications such as query matching (e.g., "does the speaker eventually sound happy in this audio clip?"), and ranked retrieval (e.g., "retrieve top 5 videos with a 10 second scene where a car is detected until a pedestrian is detected"). In this work, we formalize this problem of assigning Scores for TempOral Properties (STOPs) over sequences, given potentially noisy score predictors for local properties. We then propose a scoring function called LogSTOP that can efficiently compute these scores for temporal properties represented in Linear Temporal Logic. Empirically, LogSTOP, with YOLO and HuBERT, outperforms Large Vision / Audio Language Models and other Temporal Logic-based baselines by at least 16% on query matching with temporal properties over objects-in-videos and emotions-in-speech respectively. Similarly, on ranked retrieval with temporal properties over objects and actions in videos, LogSTOP with Grounding DINO and SlowR50 reports at least a 19% and 16% increase in mean average precision and recall over zero-shot text-to-video retrieval baselines respectively.<br>

Traditional data augmentation techniques often face challenges in manipulating high-level semantic attributes, such as materials and textures. In contrast, diffusion models offer a robust alternative, by effectively utilizing text-to-image or image-to-image transformation. However, existing diffusion-based methods are either computationally expensive or compromise on performance. To address this issue, we introduce a novel training-free pipeline that integrates pretrained ControlNet and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate synthetic images paired with pixel-level labels. This approach eliminates the need for manual annotations and significantly improves downstream tasks. To improve the fidelity and diversity, we add a Multi-way Prompt Generator, Mask Generator and High-quality Image Selection module.

Security vulnerabilities are no longer discovered and shared only through formal channels such as public vulnerability databases or vendor advisories. Increasingly, criti- cal threat information emerges informally through blogs, social media, developer forums, open source repositories, and even underground com- munities. To this end, capturing such intelligence in a timely manner is essential for maintaining situational awareness and enabling prompt security responses. However, this remains a complex challenge due to the fragmented nature of data sources and the technical difficulty of collecting, parsing, mapping, and validating information at scale. To ad- dress this, we propose Evolaris, a self-evolving software intelligence sys- tem built on a multi-agent framework. Evolaris is designed to support a full-stack workflow, where agents operate independently but coordinate through shared context to perform tasks such as information discovery, reasoning, gap completion, validation, and risk detection. This archi- tecture enables the platform to learn from new inputs, refine its internal knowledge, and adapt to emerging threat patterns over time, which could continuously improve the precision, timeliness, and scalability of software threat analysis, and offers a sustainable foundation for proactive secu- rity decision-making and strengthens the broader ecosystem of security threat understanding.<br>

While current LLM-based agent models demonstrate competitive performance, they still exhibit significant deviations from real-world fund companies. A critical distinction lies in the agents' reliance on ``post-reflection'', particularly in response to adverse outcomes, but lack a distinctly human capability: long-term prediction of future trends. Therefore, we introduce QuantAgents, a multi-agent system integrating simulated trading, to comprehensively evaluate various investment strategies and market scenarios without assuming actual risks. Specifically, QuantAgents comprises four agents: a simulated trading analyst, a risk control analyst, a market news analyst, and a manager, who collaborate through several meetings. Moreover, our system incentivizes agents to receive feedback on two fronts: performance in real-world markets and predictive accuracy in simulated trading. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework excels across all metrics, yielding an overall return of nearly 300% over the three years (https://quantagents.github.io/).<br>

Although RL algorithms can substantially improve reasoning, they struggle to expand reasoning boundaries because they learn from their own reasoning trajectories rather than acquiring external knowledge. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) offers complementary benefits but typically requires large-scale data and risks overfitting. Recent attempts to combine SFT and RL face three main challenges: data inefficiency, algorithm-specific designs, and catastrophic forgetting. We propose a plug-and-play framework that dynamically integrates SFT into RL by selecting challenging examples for SFT. This approach reduces SFT data requirements and remains agnostic to the choice of RL or SFT algorithm. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting of RL-acquired skills during SFT, we select high-entropy tokens for loss calculation and freeze parameters identified as critical for RL. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) reasoning performance using only 1.5% of the SFT data and 20.4% of the RL data used by prior SoTA, providing an efficient and plug-and-play solution for combining SFT and RL in reasoning post-training.<br>

When the 'agents' are large language models (LLMs), however, the classical psychological explanation is not directly applicable, since SoS was developed for human societies. This raises a central question: can SoS-like dynamics nevertheless emerge from purely statistical language generation in LLM collectives? We propose an evaluation framework for examining SoS in LLM agents. Specifically, we consider four controlled conditions that systematically vary the availability of 'History' and 'Persona' signals. Opinion dynamics are assessed using trend tests such as Mann-Kendall and Spearman's rank, along with concentration measures including kurtosis and interquartile range. Experiments across open-source and closed-source models show that history and persona together produce strong majority dominance and replicate SoS patterns; history signals alone induce strong anchoring; and persona signals alone foster diverse but uncorrelated opinions, indicating that without historical anchoring, SoS dynamics cannot emerge. The work bridges computational sociology and responsible AI design, highlighting the need to monitor and mitigate emergent conformity in LLM-agent systems.<br>

However, state-of-the-art visual policies often overfit to a single track and their performance degrades when track geometry changes. We develop FalconGym 2.0, a photorealistic simulation framework built on Gaussian Splatting (GSplat) with an Edit API that programmatically generates diverse static and dynamic tracks in milliseconds. Leveraging FalconGym 2.0's editability, we propose a Performance-Guided Refinement (PGR) algorithm, which concentrates visual policy's training on challenging tracks while iteratively improving its performance. Across two case studies (fixed-wing UAVs and quadrotors) with distinct dynamics and environments, we show that a single visual policy trained with PGR in FalconGym 2.0 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generalization and robustness: it generalizes to three unseen tracks with 100% success without per-track retraining and maintains higher success rates under gate-pose perturbations. Finally, we demonstrate that the visual policy trained with PGR in FalconGym 2.0 can be zero-shot sim-to-real transferred to a quadrotor hardware, achieving a 98.6% success rate (69 / 70 gates) over 30 trials spanning two three-gate tracks and a moving-gate track.<br>

This systematic literature review (SLR) explores research on ASR for African languages with a focus on datasets, models and training methods, evaluation techniques, challenges, and recommends future directions. We employ the PRISMA 2020 procedures and search DBLP, ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, and arXiv for studies published between January 2020 and July 2025. We include studies related to ASR datasets, models or metrics for African languages, while excluding non-African, duplicates, and low-quality studies (score <3/5). We screen 71 out of 2,062 records and we record a total of 74 datasets across 111 languages, encompassing approximately 11,206 hours of speech. Fewer than 15% of research provided reproducible materials, and dataset licensing is not clear. Self-supervised and transfer learning techniques are promising, but are hindered by limited pre-training data, inadequate coverage of dialects, and the availability of resources. Most of the researchers use Word Error Rate (WER), with very minimal use of linguistically informed scores such as Character Error Rate (CER) or Diacritic Error Rate (DER), and thus with limited application in tonal and morphologically rich languages. The existing evidence on ASR systems is inconsistent, hindered by issues like dataset availability, poor annotations, licensing uncertainties, and limited benchmarking. Nevertheless, the rise of community-driven initiatives and methodological advancements indicates a pathway for improvement. Sustainable development for this area will also include stakeholder partnership, creation of ethically well-balanced datasets, use of lightweight modelling techniques, and active benchmarking.<br>

From the symmetry perspective, we propose two complementary methods: EvolAST, an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) based approach that targets syntactic symmetry to generate semantically equivalent problem variants, and EvolDomain, which leverages LLMs to address semantic symmetry by translating theorems across mathematical domains. From the difficulty perspective, we propose EvolDifficulty, which uses carefully designed evolutionary instructions to guide LLMs in generating new theorems with a wider range of difficulty. We then use the evolved data to train EvolProver, a 7B-parameter non-reasoning theorem prover. EvolProver establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on FormalMATH-Lite with a 53.8% pass@32 rate, surpassing all models of comparable size, including reasoning-based models. It also sets new SOTA records for non-reasoning models on MiniF2F-Test (69.8% pass@32), Ineq-Comp-Seed (52.2% pass@32), and Ineq-Comp-Transformed (34.0% pass@32). Ablation studies further confirm our data augmentation pipeline's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks.<br>

Several package managers address this with the generation of a lockfile that freezes dependency versions and can be used to verify the integrity of dependencies. Yet, Maven, one of the most important package managers in the Java ecosystem, lacks native support for a lockfile. We present Maven-Lockfile to generate and update lockfiles, with support for rebuilding projects from past versions. Our lockfiles capture all direct and transitive dependencies with their checksums, enabling high integrity builds. Our evaluation shows that Maven-Lockfile can reproduce builds from historical commits and is able to detect tampered artifacts. With minimal configuration, Maven-Lockfile equips Java projects with modern build integrity and build reproducibility, and fosters future research on software supply chain security in Java.<br>

This imbalance creates a significant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations instead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant predictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we propose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework. Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the learning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial reference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model to move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying causal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations from a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance caused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise Normalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization objective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain waypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two denoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the learning task and improves model performance. The code will be released to facilitate further research.<br>

In this work, we investigate whether this phenomenon can extend beyond safety behaviors to a broader spectrum of dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios (e.g., lying under pressure and deceptive behavior). To explore this, we finetune open-sourced LLMs on misaligned completions across diverse domains. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs show broadly misaligned behavior in dishonesty. Additionally, we further explore this phenomenon in a downstream combined finetuning setting, and find that introducing as little as 1% of misalignment data into a standard downstream task is sufficient to decrease honest behavior over 20%. Furthermore, we consider a more practical human-AI interaction environment where we simulate both benign and biased users to interact with the assistant LLM. Notably, we find that the assistant can be misaligned unintentionally to exacerbate its dishonesty with only 10% biased user population. In summary, we extend the study of emergent misalignment to the domain of dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios, and demonstrate that this risk arises not only through direct finetuning, but also in downstream mixture tasks and practical human-AI interactions.<br>

However, LLM hallucinations present a significant challenge, often leading to overconfident yet potentially misaligned or unsafe plans. While researchers have explored uncertainty estimation to improve the reliability of LLM-based planning, existing studies have not sufficiently differentiated between epistemic and intrinsic uncertainty, limiting the effectiveness of uncertainty estimation. In this paper, we present Combined Uncertainty estimation for Reliable Embodied planning (CURE), which decomposes the uncertainty into epistemic and intrinsic uncertainty, each estimated separately. Furthermore, epistemic uncertainty is subdivided into task clarity and task familiarity for more accurate evaluation. The overall uncertainty assessments are obtained using random network distillation and multi-layer perceptron regression heads driven by LLM features. We validated our approach in two distinct experimental settings: kitchen manipulation and tabletop rearrangement experiments. The results show that, compared to existing methods, our approach yields uncertainty estimates that are more closely aligned with the actual execution outcomes.<br>

While Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) improve efficiency via latent-space processing, their Gaussian constraint often discards degradation-specific high-frequency information, hurting reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this, we propose Latent Harmony, a two-stage framework that redefines VAEs for UHD restoration by jointly regularizing the latent space and enforcing high-frequency-aware reconstruction.In Stage One, we introduce LH-VAE, which enhances semantic robustness through visual semantic constraints and progressive degradation perturbations, while latent equivariance strengthens high-frequency reconstruction.Stage Two jointly trains this refined VAE with a restoration model using High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA): an encoder LoRA guided by a fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss to recover authentic details, and a decoder LoRA driven by a perception-oriented loss to synthesize realistic textures. Both LoRA modules are trained via alternating optimization with selective gradient propagation to preserve the pretrained latent structure.At inference, a tunable parameter α enables flexible fidelity-perception trade-offs.Experiments show Latent Harmony achieves state-of-the-art performance across UHD and standard-resolution tasks, effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction accuracy.<br>

However, existing methods often lack the fine-grained control needed to generate viewpoint-specific content from larger, immersive 360-degree environments. This limitation restricts the creation of audio-visual experiences that are aware of off-camera events. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a framework for controllable audio-visual generation, addressing this unexplored gap. Specifically, we propose a diffusion model by introducing a set of powerful conditioning signals derived from the full 360-degree space: a panoramic saliency map to identify regions of interest, a bounding-box-aware signed distance map to define the target viewpoint, and a descriptive caption of the entire scene. By integrating these controls, our model generates spatially-aware viewpoint videos and audios that are coherently influenced by the broader, unseen environmental context, introducing a strong controllability that is essential for realistic and immersive audio-visual generation. We show audiovisual examples proving the effectiveness of our framework.<br>

However, such control schemes require sharing privacy-sensitive vehicle data, which introduces risks of information leakage and potential malicious activities. This paper investigates the stability and privacy-preserving properties of distributed platoon control under two types of quantizers: deterministic and probabilistic. For deterministic quantization, we show that the resulting control strategy ensures the system errors remain uniformly ultimately bounded. Moreover, in the absence of auxiliary information, an eavesdropper cannot uniquely infer sensitive vehicle states. In contrast, the use of probabilistic quantization enables asymptotic convergence of the vehicle platoon in expectation with bounded variance. Importantly, probabilistic quantizers can satisfy differential privacy guarantees, thereby preserving privacy even when the eavesdropper possesses arbitrary auxiliary information. We further analyze the trade-off between control performance and privacy by formulating an optimization problem that characterizes the impact of the quantization step on both metrics. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the performance differences between the two quantization strategies.<br>

This study introduces LLM-Hanabi, a novel benchmark that uses the cooperative game Hanabi to evaluate the rationale inference and ToM of LLMs. Our framework features an automated evaluation system that measures both game performance and ToM proficiency. Across a range of models, we find a significant positive correlation between ToM and in-game success.

Token compression methods can reduce inference cost, but they require fixing a compression rate in advance and produce a single fixed-length output, offering no flexibility to balance information density and efficiency at inference time. Matryoshka representation learning (MRL) addresses this by enabling a single model to operate across multiple token granularities, allowing compression rates to be adjusted dynamically. However, current MRL-based methods treat each scale independently during training, limiting cross-scale generalization, robustness at high compression, and interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoME (Mixture of Matryoshka Experts), a novel framework that integrates sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) into MRL-based LLMs for AVSR. MoME augments a frozen LLM with top-k routed and shared experts, allowing dynamic capacity allocation across scales and modalities. A shared router promotes consistent expert activation across granularities, enabling compressed sequences to benefit from representations learned at lower compression. Experiments on LRS2 and LRS3 demonstrate that MoME achieves state-of-the-art performance across AVSR, ASR, and VSR tasks, while requiring significantly fewer parameters and maintaining robustness under noise. MoME unifies the adaptability of MRL with the efficiency of MoE, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for resource-aware speech recognition.<br>

However, such scaling incurs considerable training overhead, posing challenges for researchers with limited computational resources and hindering the sustained development of SNNs. Data pruning is a promising strategy for accelerating training by retaining the most informative examples and discarding redundant ones, but it remains largely unexplored in SNNs. Directly applying ANN-based data pruning methods to SNNs fails to capture the intrinsic importance of examples and suffers from high gradient variance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel spike-aware data pruning (SADP) method. SADP reduces gradient variance by determining each example's selection probability to be proportional to its gradient norm, while avoiding the high cost of direct gradient computation through an efficient upper bound, termed spike-aware importance score. This score accounts for the influence of all-or-nothing spikes on the gradient norm and can be computed with negligible overhead. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that SADP consistently outperforms data pruning baselines and achieves training speedups close to the theoretical maxima at different pruning ratios. Notably, SADP reduces training time by 35% on ImageNet while maintaining accuracy comparable to that of full-data training. This work, therefore, establishes a data-centric paradigm for efficient SNN training and paves the way for scaling SNNs to larger models and datasets. The source code will be released publicly after the review process.<br>

While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become a mainstream approach, existing methods often suffer from uncontrolled generation, insufficient quality, and limited diversity in reasoning paths. Recent efforts leverage code to enhance CoT by grounding reasoning in executable steps, but such methods are typically constrained to predefined mathematical problems, hindering scalability and generalizability. In this work, we propose Caco (Code-Assisted Chain-of-ThOught), a novel framework that automates the synthesis of high-quality, verifiable, and diverse instruction-CoT reasoning data through code-driven augmentation. Unlike prior work, Caco first fine-tunes a code-based CoT generator on existing math and programming solutions in a unified code format, then scales the data generation to a large amount of diverse reasoning traces. Crucially, we introduce automated validation via code execution and rule-based filtering to ensure logical correctness and structural diversity, followed by reverse-engineering filtered outputs into natural language instructions and language CoTs to enrich task adaptability. This closed-loop process enables fully automated, scalable synthesis of reasoning data with guaranteed executability. Experiments on our created Caco-1.3M dataset demonstrate that Caco-trained models achieve strong competitive performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, outperforming existing strong baselines. Further analysis reveals that Caco's code-anchored verification and instruction diversity contribute to superior generalization across unseen tasks. Our work establishes a paradigm for building self-sustaining, trustworthy reasoning systems without human intervention.<br>

To address this challenge, we present Spatial CAPTCHA, a novel human-verification framework that leverages fundamental differences in spatial reasoning between humans and MLLMs. Unlike existing CAPTCHAs which rely on low-level perception tasks that are vulnerable to modern AI, Spatial CAPTCHA generates dynamic questions requiring geometric reasoning, perspective-taking, occlusion handling, and mental rotation. These skills are intuitive for humans but difficult for state-of-the-art (SOTA) AI systems. The system employs a procedural generation pipeline with constraint-based difficulty control, automated correctness verification, and human-in-the-loop validation to ensure scalability, robustness, and adaptability. Evaluation on a corresponding benchmark, Spatial-CAPTCHA-Bench, demonstrates that humans vastly outperform 10 state-of-the-art MLLMs, with the best model achieving only 31.0% Pass@1 accuracy. Furthermore, we compare Spatial CAPTCHA with Google reCAPTCHA, which confirms its effectiveness as both a security mechanism and a diagnostic tool for spatial reasoning in AI.<br>

However, a key challenge in LLM-based textual graph QA systems lies in graph retrieval, i.e., how to retrieve relevant content from large graphs that is sufficiently informative while remaining compact for the LLM context. Existing retrievers suffer from poor performance since they either rely on shallow embedding similarity or employ interactive retrieving policies that demand excessive data labeling and training cost. To address these issues, we present Graph-$S^3$, an agentic textual graph reasoning framework that employs an LLM-based retriever trained with synthetic stepwise supervision. Instead of rewarding the agent based on the final answers, which may lead to sparse and unstable training signals, we propose to closely evaluate each step of the retriever based on offline-extracted golden subgraphs. Our main techniques include a data synthesis pipeline to extract the golden subgraphs for reward generation and a two-stage training scheme to learn the interactive graph exploration policy based on the synthesized rewards. Based on extensive experiments on three common datasets in comparison with seven strong baselines, our approach achieves an average improvement of 8.1\% in accuracy and 9.7\% in F$_1$ score. The advantage is even higher in more complicated multi-hop reasoning tasks. Our code will be open-sourced.<br>

Standard LLM serving systems suffer from the inflexibility caused by non-preemptive request scheduling and reactive memory management, leading to poor resource utilization and low request processing parallelism under request bursts. Therefore, we present TokenFlow, a novel LLM serving system with enhanced text streaming performance via preemptive request scheduling and proactive key-value (KV) cache management. TokenFlow dynamically prioritizes requests based on real-time token buffer occupancy and token consumption rate, while actively transferring KV cache between GPU and CPU memory in the background and overlapping I/O with computation to minimize request preemption overhead. Extensive experiments on Llama3-8B and Qwen2.5-32B across multiple GPUs (RTX 4090, A6000, H200) demonstrate that TokenFlow achieves up to 82.5% higher effective throughput (accounting for actual user consumption) while reducing P99 TTFT by up to 80.2%, without degrading overall token throughput.<br>

However, LoRA assumes a uniform rank \textit{r} for each incremental matrix, not accounting for the varying significance of weight matrices across different modules and layers. AdaLoRA leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to parameterize updates and employs pruning of singular values to introduce dynamic rank allocation, thereby enhancing adaptability. However, during the training process, it often encounters issues of slow convergence speed and high computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose HyperAdaLoRA, a novel framework that accelerates the convergence of AdaLoRA by leveraging a hypernetwork. Instead of directly optimizing the components of Singular Value Decomposition $(P, Λ, Q)$, HyperAdaLoRA employs a hypernetwork based on attention mechanisms to dynamically generate these parameters. By pruning the outputs of the hypernetwork that generates the singular values, dynamic rank allocation is achieved. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets and models demonstrate that our method achieves faster convergence without sacrificing performance. Additionally, further extension experiments on other LoRA-based approaches validate the broad applicability of our method.<br>

We introduce MathLens, a benchmark designed to disentangle the subskills of multimodal reasoning while preserving the complexity of textbook-style geometry problems. The benchmark separates performance into three components: Perception: extracting information from raw inputs, Reasoning: operating on available information, and Integration: selecting relevant perceptual evidence and applying it within reasoning. To support each test, we provide annotations: visual diagrams, textual descriptions to evaluate reasoning in isolation, controlled questions that require both modalities, and probes for fine-grained perceptual skills, all derived from symbolic specifications of the problems to ensure consistency and robustness. Our analysis reveals that different training approaches have uneven effects: First, reinforcement learning chiefly strengthens perception, especially when supported by textual supervision, while textual SFT indirectly improves perception through reflective reasoning. Second, reasoning improves only in tandem with perception. Third, integration remains the weakest capacity, with residual errors concentrated there once other skills advance. Finally, robustness diverges: RL improves consistency under diagram variation, whereas multimodal SFT reduces it through overfitting. We will release all data and experimental logs.<br>

Traditional machine-learning approaches often struggle to capture the complex relationships and hierarchical structures of sequence data when working in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. This limitation hinders accurate sequence classification and similarity measurement. To address these challenges, this research proposes a method to transform the feature representation of biological sequences into the hyperboloid space. By applying a transformation, the sequences are mapped onto the hyperboloid, preserving their inherent structural information. Once the sequences are represented in the hyperboloid space, a kernel matrix is computed based on the hyperboloid features. The kernel matrix captures the pairwise similarities between sequences, enabling more effective analysis of biological sequence relationships. This approach leverages the inner product of the hyperboloid feature vectors to measure the similarity between pairs of sequences. The experimental evaluation of the proposed approach demonstrates its efficacy in capturing important sequence correlations and improving classification accuracy.<br>

However, existing agent benchmarks are showing a trend of rapid ceiling-hitting by newly developed agents, making it difficult to meet the demands for evaluating agent abilities. To address this problem, we propose the Trajectory-based Validated-by-Reproducing Agent-benchmark Complexity Evolution (TRACE) framework. This framework takes an original task from an existing benchmark and encourages agents to freely explore and evolve it into a new task with higher difficulty while recording validatable agent trajectories. The framework proceeds in three stages: (1) evolutionary proposal mining, which provides task evolution proposals through preliminary exploration and divergent thinking; (2) problem formation and free exploration, where proposals are conceptualized into feasible problem candidates and the agents then explore them freely while recording their execution trajectories; and (3) multi-level validation, which ensures that the evolved tasks are accompanied by validatable and reproducible trajectories. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate that the TRACE framework consistently enhances task complexity while improving the reliability of correctness through validatable execution trajectories. This work marks a paradigm shift from static, manually curated benchmarks to dynamic, self-evolving evaluation systems, providing a sustainable and challenging runway for agent development.<br>

In this work, we reveal the security and robustness vulnerabilities of these agents through backdoor attacks. Distinct from traditional backdoors limited to single-step control, we propose the Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri), a multi-step backdoor attack designed for long-horizon agentic control. CoTri relies on an ordered sequence. It starts with an initial trigger, and subsequent ones are drawn from the environment, allowing multi-step manipulation that diverts the agent from its intended task. Experimental results show that CoTri achieves a near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) while maintaining a near-zero false trigger rate (FTR). Due to training data modeling the stochastic nature of the environment, the implantation of CoTri paradoxically enhances the agent's performance on benign tasks and even improves its robustness against environmental distractions. We further validate CoTri on vision-language models (VLMs), confirming its scalability to multimodal agents. Our work highlights that CoTri achieves stable, multi-step control within agents, improving their inherent robustness and task capabilities, which ultimately makes the attack more stealthy and raises potential safty risks.<br>

Notably, popular inference engines, such as vLLM, enable users to conveniently prune downloaded models before they are deployed. While the utility and efficiency of pruning methods have improved significantly, the security implications of pruning remain underexplored. In this work, for the first time, we show that modern LLM pruning methods can be maliciously exploited. In particular, an adversary can construct a model that appears benign yet, once pruned, exhibits malicious behaviors. Our method is based on the idea that the adversary can compute a proxy metric that estimates how likely each parameter is to be pruned. With this information, the adversary can first inject a malicious behavior into those parameters that are unlikely to be pruned. Then, they can repair the model by using parameters that are likely to be pruned, effectively canceling out the injected behavior in the unpruned model. We demonstrate the severity of our attack through extensive evaluation on five models; after any of the pruning in vLLM are applied (Magnitude, Wanda, and SparseGPT), it consistently exhibits strong malicious behaviors in a diverse set of attack scenarios (success rates of up to $95.7\%$ for jailbreak, $98.7\%$ for benign instruction refusal, and $99.5\%$ for targeted content injection). Our results reveal a critical deployment-time security gap and underscore the urgent need for stronger security awareness in model compression.<br>

Recent studies have explored rubrics-as-rewards (RaR) that uses structured natural language criteria that capture multiple dimensions of response quality. However, producing rubrics that are both reliable and scalable remains a key challenge. In this work, we introduce OpenRubrics, a diverse, large-scale collection of (prompt, rubric) pairs for training rubric-generation and rubric-based reward models. To elicit discriminative and comprehensive evaluation signals, we introduce Contrastive Rubric Generation (CRG), which derives both hard rules (explicit constraints) and principles (implicit qualities) by contrasting preferred and rejected responses. We further improve reliability by enforcing preference-label consistency via rejection sampling to remove noisy rubrics. Across multiple reward-modeling benchmarks, our rubric-based reward model, Rubric-RM, surpasses strong size-matched baselines by 6.8%. These gains transfer to policy models on instruction-following and biomedical benchmarks. Our results show that rubrics provide scalable alignment signals that narrow the gap between costly human evaluation and automated reward modeling, enabling a new principle-driven paradigm for LLM alignment.<br>

To bridge this gap, we introduce PEAR, a benchmark for systematically evaluating both the utility and vulnerability of planner-executor MAS. While compatible with various MAS architectures, our benchmark focuses on the planner-executor structure, which is a practical and widely adopted design. Through extensive experiments, we find that (1) a weak planner degrades overall clean task performance more severely than a weak executor; (2) while a memory module is essential for the planner, having a memory module for the executor does not impact the clean task performance; (3) there exists a trade-off between task performance and robustness; and (4) attacks targeting the planner are particularly effective at misleading the system.

Recent advancements in lunar satellite communication make it possible to establish a wireless link between lunar orbit satellites and the lunar lander. This enables satellites to run high-performance autonomous landing algorithms, improving landing accuracy while reducing the lander's computational and storage load. Nevertheless, traditional communication paradigms are not directly applicable due to significant temperature fluctuations on the lunar surface, intense solar radiation, and severe interference caused by lunar dust on hardware. The emerging technique of semantic communication (SemCom) offers significant advantages in robustness and resource efficiency, particularly under harsh channel conditions. In this paper, we introduce a novel SemCom framework for transmitting images from the lander to satellites operating the remote landing control system. The proposed encoder-decoder dynamically adjusts the transmission strategy based on real-time feedback from the lander's control algorithm, ensuring the accurate delivery of critical image features and enhancing control reliability. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of the conditions that improve the accuracy of the control algorithm and reduce end-to-end transmission time under the proposed framework. Simulation results demonstrate that our SemCom method significantly enhances autonomous landing performance compared to traditional communication methods.<br>

Combining UAVs' broad field of view with UGVs' ground-level operational capability greatly improve the likelihood of successfully achieving task objectives such as locating victims, monitoring target areas, or navigating hazardous terrain. In complex environments, UAVs need to provide precise environmental perception information for UGVs to optimize their routing policy. However, due to severe interference and non-line-of-sight conditions, wireless communication is often unstable in such complex environments, making it difficult to support timely and accurate path planning for UAV-UGV coordination. To this end, this paper proposes a semantic communication (SemCom) framework to enhance UAV/UGV cooperative path planning under unreliable wireless conditions. Unlike traditional methods that transmit raw data, SemCom transmits only the key information for path planning, reducing transmission volume without sacrificing accuracy. The proposed framework is developed by defining key semantics for path planning and designing a transceiver for meeting the requirements of UAV-UGV cooperative path planning. Simulation results show that, compared to conventional SemCom transceivers, the proposed transceiver significantly reduces data transmission volume while maintaining path planning accuracy, thereby enhancing system collaboration efficiency.<br>

Our approach tracks information lift -- the log-likelihood ratio between full models and deliberately weakened "skeleton" baselines -- using self-normalized empirical-Bernstein e-processes that provide formal delta-level error control regardless of stopping time. We handle unknown centering through online mean estimation, combine multiple parameters via mixture e-processes, and support adaptive resets under distributional drift. On six benchmarks, Sequential-EDFL reduces generation by 22-28% vs. sequential baselines while maintaining delta-level control with 12% computational overhead. We introduce automated skeletons (distilled submodels, randomized logits) and show robustness across skeleton families. Composing EDFL with a lightweight correctness gate (sentence boundaries + verifier) improves end-task correctness while preserving anytime-valid guarantees by only delaying stopping. Our certificates control information sufficiency, not factual correctness -- 10.9% of stopped sequences remain incorrect even with the gate (13.2-22.7% without it).

Methods: This retrospective study included radiography series of the clavicle (n=1,170), elbow (n=3,755), and thumb (n=1,978). After anonymization, GPT-4o filled out structured templates by indicating imaging findings as present ("true"), absent ("false"), or "uncertain." To assess the impact of label uncertainty, "uncertain" labels of the training and validation sets were automatically reassigned to "true" (inclusive) or "false" (exclusive). Label-image-pairs were used for multi-label classification using ResNet50. Label extraction accuracy was manually verified on internal (clavicle: n=233, elbow: n=745, thumb: n=393) and external test sets (n=300 for each). Performance was assessed using macro-averaged receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC), precision recall curves, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. AUCs were compared with the DeLong test. Results: Automatic extraction was correct in 98.6% (60,618 of 61,488) of labels in the test sets. Across anatomic regions, label-based model training yielded competitive performance measured by macro-averaged AUC values for inclusive (e.g., elbow: AUC=0.80 [range, 0.62-0.87]) and exclusive models (elbow: AUC=0.80 [range, 0.61-0.88]). Models generalized well on external datasets (elbow [inclusive]: AUC=0.79 [range, 0.61-0.87]; elbow [exclusive]: AUC=0.79 [range, 0.63-0.89]). No significant differences were observed across labeling strategies or datasets (p>=0.15).

Since human studies are costly, time-consuming, and hard to reproduce, recent work explores using LLMs to simulate users for automatic assistant evaluation. However, there is no benchmark or systematic study to evaluate whether these simulated users are reliable stand-ins for real users. To address this, we introduce SimulatorArena, a benchmark of 909 annotated human-LLM conversations on two interactive tasks -- math tutoring and document creation. SimulatorArena evaluates simulators based on how closely their messages match human behavior and how well their assistant ratings align with human judgments. Experiments on various simulator methods show that simulators conditioned on user profiles, capturing traits like background and message styles, align closely with human judgments. They reach Spearman's $ρ$ of 0.7 on both tasks, providing a practical, scalable alternative to human evaluation. Using the best simulator for each task, we benchmark 18 assistants, including the latest LLMs such as GPT-5, Claude 4.1 Opus, and Gemini 2.5 Pro.<br>

KV quantization is a key lever for reducing cache cost, but accuracy drops sharply as the native KV distribution lacks flatness and thus maintains a wide quantization range. Prior work focuses on isolating outliers, which caps their error but fails to flatten the overall distribution, leaving performance fragile under low-bit settings. In this work, we show that the K cache maintains a stable structure that evolves gradually with context, while the V cache carries latent semantic regularities. Building on these insights, we propose PatternKV, a pattern-aligned residual quantization scheme. It mines representative pattern vectors online, aligns each KV vector to its nearest pattern, and quantizes only the residual. This reshaping of the KV distribution flattens the quantization target and narrows its range, thereby improving the fidelity of low-bit KV quantization. Across long-context and test-time scaling settings on multiple backbones, PatternKV delivers consistent 2-bit gains, with a 0.08% average 4-bit drop relative to FP16, improves test-time scaling accuracy by 10% on average, and raises throughput by 1.4x while supporting 1.25x larger batches.<br>

Existing approaches typically embed node, edge, and graph-level features into a unified latent space, modeling prediction tasks including classification and regression as a form of conditional generation. However, due to the non-Euclidean nature of graph data, features of different curvatures are entangled in the same latent space without releasing their geometric potential. To address this issue, we aim to construt an ideal Riemannian diffusion model to capture distinct manifold signatures of complex graph data and learn their distribution. This goal faces two challenges: numerical instability caused by exponential mapping during the encoding proces and manifold deviation during diffusion generation. To address these challenges, we propose GeoMancer: a novel Riemannian graph diffusion framework for both generation and prediction tasks. To mitigate numerical instability, we replace exponential mapping with an isometric-invariant Riemannian gyrokernel approach and decouple multi-level features onto their respective task-specific manifolds to learn optimal representations. To address manifold deviation, we introduce a manifold-constrained diffusion method and a self-guided strategy for unconditional generation, ensuring that the generated data remains aligned with the manifold signature. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating superior performance across a variety of tasks.<br>

Autoregressive Language Models (ARMs), which generate tokens sequentially conditioned on all previous tokens, have been the predominant paradigm for LLMs. However, while these networks have achieved high accuracy across a range of downstream tasks, they exhibit low arithmetic intensity due to the inherent sequential dependency with next-token prediction. Recently, Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative architecture. DLMs generate output text in parallel, breaking the limitations of sequential dependency. However, the performance implications of DLMs relative to commonly deployed ARMs are not fully understood. In this work, we present a comprehensive performance study analyzing the performance characteristics of ARMs and DLMs, using both theoretical analysis and profiling data to characterize the trade-offs between these approaches. We illustrate that although DLMs exhibit higher arithmetic intensity compared to ARMs because of their capability to utilize parallelism across sequence lengths, they fail to scale effectively to longer contexts. We then explore DLMs with block-wise decoding, outlining how this approach allows for increased arithmetic intensity, while still scaling well to long contexts (similar to ARMs). We also show interesting trade-offs for batched inference, where we find that ARMs exhibit superior throughput, as they benefit more from parallelism across sequences in the batch. Finally, we highlight opportunities for accelerating DLM inference, and, in particular, highlight the importance of reducing the number of sampling steps for allowing open-source DLMs to provide improved latency relative to ARMs.<br>

Our findings reveal that LLMs generate 15\%-25\% conceptually irrelevant interpretations, depend on metaphorical indicators in training data rather than contextual cues, and are more sensitive to syntactic irregularities than to structural comprehension.

To address these limitations, we introduce DuPLUS, a deep learning framework for efficient multi-modal medical image analysis. DuPLUS introduces a novel vision-language framework that leverages hierarchical semantic prompts for fine-grained control over the analysis task, a capability absent in prior universal models. To enable extensibility to other medical tasks, it includes a hierarchical, text-controlled architecture driven by a unique dual-prompt mechanism. For segmentation, DuPLUS is able to generalize across three imaging modalities, ten different anatomically various medical datasets, encompassing more than 30 organs and tumor types. It outperforms the state-of-the-art task specific and universal models on 8 out of 10 datasets. We demonstrate extensibility of its text-controlled architecture by seamless integration of electronic health record (EHR) data for prognosis prediction, and on a head and neck cancer dataset, DuPLUS achieved a Concordance Index (CI) of 0.69. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning enables rapid adaptation to new tasks and modalities from varying centers, establishing DuPLUS as a versatile and clinically relevant solution for medical image analysis.

However, while achieving notable performance in generation quality, these models are limited by their generating speed, often requiring hundreds of iterative steps in the reverse-diffusion process. This computational bottleneck limits their practical utility in large-scale protein discovery, where thousands to millions of candidate structures are needed. To address this challenge, we explore the techniques of score distillation, which has shown great success in reducing the number of sampling steps in the vision domain while maintaining high generation quality. However, a straightforward adaptation of these methods results in unacceptably low designability. Through extensive study, we have identified how to appropriately adapt Score identity Distillation (SiD), a state-of-the-art score distillation strategy, to train few-step protein backbone generators which significantly reduce sampling time, while maintaining comparable performance to their pretrained teacher model. In particular, multistep generation combined with inference time noise modulation is key to the success. We demonstrate that our distilled few-step generators achieve more than a 20-fold improvement in sampling speed, while achieving similar levels of designability, diversity, and novelty as the Proteina teacher model. This reduction in inference cost enables large-scale in silico protein design, thereby bringing diffusion-based models closer to real-world protein engineering applications.<br>

While existing methods leveraging large generative models demonstrate impressive results, the high computational cost and latency make them impractical for edge deployment. In this paper, we introduce PocketSR, an ultra-lightweight, single-step model that brings generative modeling capabilities to RealSR while maintaining high fidelity. To achieve this, we design LiteED, a highly efficient alternative to the original computationally intensive VAE in SD, reducing parameters by 97.5% while preserving high-quality encoding and decoding. Additionally, we propose online annealing pruning for the U-Net, which progressively shifts generative priors from heavy modules to lightweight counterparts, ensuring effective knowledge transfer and further optimizing efficiency. To mitigate the loss of prior knowledge during pruning, we incorporate a multi-layer feature distillation loss. Through an in-depth analysis of each design component, we provide valuable insights for future research. PocketSR, with a model size of 146M parameters, processes 4K images in just 0.8 seconds, achieving a remarkable speedup over previous methods. Notably, it delivers performance on par with state-of-the-art single-step and even multi-step RealSR models, making it a highly practical solution for edge-device applications.<br>

Our work is inspired by prior work in the image domain on forensic similarity, which proved strong generalization capabilities against unknown forensic traces, without requiring prior knowledge of them at training time. To achieve this in the audio setting, we propose a two-part deep-learning system composed of a feature extractor based on a speech deepfake detector backbone and a shallow neural network, referred to as the similarity network. This system maps pairs of audio segments to a score indicating whether they contain the same or different forensic traces. We evaluate the system on the emerging task of source verification, highlighting its ability to identify whether two samples originate from the same generative model. Additionally, we assess its applicability to splicing detection as a complementary use case. Experiments show that the method generalizes to a wide range of forensic traces, including previously unseen ones, illustrating its flexibility and practical value in digital audio forensics.<br>

To address this challenge, we turn to representation alignment, an approach that has proven effective for bringing features from different sources into a shared space. Specifically, we target the representations of DETR-style object queries and propose a simple, detector-agnostic framework to align them with modality context. First, we define modality tokens: compact, text-derived embeddings encoding imaging modality that are lightweight and require no extra annotations. We integrate the modality tokens into the detection process via Multimodality Context Attention (MoCA), mixing object-query representations via self-attention to propagate modality context within the query set. This preserves DETR-style architectures and adds negligible latency while injecting modality cues into object queries. We further introduce QueryREPA, a short pretraining stage that aligns query representations to their modality tokens using a task-specific contrastive objective with modality-balanced batches. Together, MoCA and QueryREPA produce modality-aware, class-faithful queries that transfer effectively to downstream training. Across diverse modalities trained altogether, the proposed approach consistently improves AP with minimal overhead and no architectural modifications, offering a practical path toward robust multimodality medical object detection.

Early-exit reduces latency by terminating inference at intermediate layers, yet its task-dependent nature limits generalization across diverse scenarios. We observe that this limitation aligns with autonomous driving: navigation systems can anticipate upcoming contexts (e.g., intersections, traffic lights), indicating which tasks will be required. We propose Nav-EE, a navigation-guided early-exit framework that precomputes task-specific exit layers offline and dynamically applies them online based on navigation priors. Experiments on CODA, Waymo, and BOSCH show that Nav-EE achieves accuracy comparable to full inference while reducing latency by up to 63.9%. Real-vehicle integration with Autoware Universe further demonstrates reduced inference latency (600ms to 300ms), supporting faster decision-making in complex scenarios. These results suggest that coupling navigation foresight with early-exit offers a viable path toward efficient deployment of large models in autonomous systems.

Unlike existing safety alignment methods that optimize directly for safe response, InvThink instructs models to 1) enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe outputs that proactively avoid these risks. Our method reveals three key findings: (i) safety improvements show stronger scaling with model size compared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by training models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general reasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety tasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing (medicine, finance, law) and agentic (blackmail, murder) risk scenarios, achieving up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline methods like SafetyPrompt. We further implement InvThink via supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across three LLM families.

To address this gap, we propose a noise synthesis framework and new metrics to evaluate the robustness of REAL-MT systematically. Using this framework, we instantiate REAL-MT with Qwen-series models, including standard LLMs and large reasoning models (LRMs) with enhanced reasoning, and evaluate their performance on idiomatic translation across high-, medium-, and low-resource language pairs under synthesized noise. Our results show that low-resource language pairs, which rely more heavily on retrieved context, degrade more severely under noise than high-resource ones and often produce nonsensical translations. Although LRMs possess enhanced reasoning capabilities, they show no improvement in error correction and are even more susceptible to noise, tending to rationalize incorrect contexts. We find that this stems from an attention shift away from the source idiom to noisy content, while confidence increases despite declining accuracy, indicating poor calibration. To mitigate these issues, we investigate training-free and fine-tuning strategies, which improve robustness at the cost of performance in clean contexts, revealing a fundamental trade-off. Our findings highlight the limitations of current approaches, underscoring the need for self-verifying integration mechanisms.<br>

While several echocardiography-specific FMs have recently been introduced, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate them. Echocardiography poses unique challenges, including noisy acquisitions, high frame redundancy, and limited public datasets. Most existing solutions evaluate on private data, restricting comparability. To address this, we introduce CardioBench, a comprehensive benchmark for echocardiography FMs. CardioBench unifies eight publicly available datasets into a standardized suite spanning four regression and five classification tasks, covering functional, structural, diagnostic, and view recognition endpoints. We evaluate several leading FM, including cardiac-specific, biomedical, and general-purpose encoders, under consistent zero-shot, probing, and alignment protocols. Our results highlight complementary strengths across model families: temporal modeling is critical for functional regression, retrieval provides robustness under distribution shift, and domain-specific text encoders capture physiologically meaningful axes. General-purpose encoders transfer strongly and often close the gap with probing, but struggle with fine-grained distinctions like view classification and subtle pathology recognition. By releasing preprocessing, splits, and public evaluation pipelines, CardioBench establishes a reproducible reference point and offers actionable insights to guide the design of future echocardiography foundation models.<br>

Despite achieving high-quality results for common benchmarks with curated data, outputs often degrade for data that contain per image variations such as strong exposure changes, present, e.g., in most scenes with indoor and outdoor areas or rooms with windows. In this paper, we introduce Neural Exposure Fields (NExF), a novel technique for robustly reconstructing 3D scenes with high quality and 3D-consistent appearance from challenging real-world captures. In the core, we propose to learn a neural field predicting an optimal exposure value per 3D point, enabling us to optimize exposure along with the neural scene representation. While capture devices such as cameras select optimal exposure per image/pixel, we generalize this concept and perform optimization in 3D instead. This enables accurate view synthesis in high dynamic range scenarios, bypassing the need of post-processing steps or multi-exposure captures. Our contributions include a novel neural representation for exposure prediction, a system for joint optimization of the scene representation and the exposure field via a novel neural conditioning mechanism, and demonstrated superior performance on challenging real-world data. We find that our approach trains faster than prior works and produces state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks improving by over 55% over best-performing baselines.<br>

At each stage of the process, we employ a localized inexact proximal point iteration to solve a simplified linear system. We show that the time complexity of such localized methods is upper bounded by $\min\{\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(R^2/ε^2), \tilde{\mathcal{O}}(m)\}$ to obtain an $ε$-approximation of the PPR vector, where $m$ denotes the number of edges in the graph and $R$ is a constant defined via nested evolving set processes. Furthermore, the algorithms induced by our framework require solving only $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrtα)$ such linear systems, where $α$ is the damping factor. When $1/ε^2\ll m$, this implies the existence of an algorithm that computes an $\ epsilon $-approximation of the PPR vector with an overall time complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(R^2 / (\sqrtαε^2)\right)$, independent of the underlying graph size. Our result resolves an open conjecture from existing literature.

This failure is particularly acute when edits involve intermediate implicit subjects within reasoning chains. Through causal analysis, we reveal that this limitation stems from an oversight of how chained knowledge is dynamically represented and utilized at the neuron level. We discover that during multi hop reasoning, implicit subjects function as query neurons, which sequentially activate corresponding value neurons across transformer layers to accumulate information toward the final answer, a dynamic prior KE work has overlooked. Guided by this insight, we propose ACE: Attribution-Controlled Knowledge Editing for Multi-hop Factual Recall, a framework that leverages neuron-level attribution to identify and edit these critical query-value (Q-V) pathways. ACE provides a mechanistically grounded solution for multi-hop KE, empirically outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 9.44% on GPT-J and 37.46% on Qwen3-8B. Our analysis further reveals more fine-grained activation patterns in Qwen3 and demonstrates that the semantic interpretability of value neurons is orchestrated by query-driven accumulation.

The challenge requires agents to operate from an egocentric perspective using only onboard sensors including RGB-D observations and odometry, without access to global maps or privileged information, while maintaining social norm compliance such as safe distances and collision avoidance. Building upon the Falcon model, we introduce a Proactive Risk Perception Module to enhance social navigation performance. Our approach augments Falcon with collision risk understanding that learns to predict distance-based collision risk scores for surrounding humans, which enables the agent to develop more robust spatial awareness and proactive collision avoidance behaviors. The evaluation on the Social-HM3D benchmark demonstrates that our method improves the agent's ability to maintain personal space compliance while navigating toward goals in crowded indoor scenes with dynamic human agents, achieving 2nd place among 16 participating teams in the challenge.<br>

While recent progress shows that multi-agent systems (MAS) can outperform single agents by coordinating specialized roles, designing effective MAS remains difficult due to prompt sensitivity and the compounded instability MAS creates. To cope with the challenge, recent efforts in automated prompt design have reduced manual effort. However, multi-agent prompt optimization remains largely unexplored. Challenges like exponentially expanding search space and ambiguous credit assignment together make systematic design intractable without principled methods. Therefore, we introduce M}ulti-Agent PRompt Optimization (MAPRO), a four-stage framework that first formulates MAS prompt optimization as a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference problem and solves it using a language-guided variant of max-product belief propagation algorithm. To address credit assignment and updates the system iteratively, MAPRO employs a topology-aware refinement mechanism that integrates execution feedback and downstream blames to selectively update agent prompts. Through this process, MAPRO progressively converges to a coordinated set of agent-specific prompt policies. Across benchmarks in various tasks, MAPRO achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpassing manually engineered baselines and recent automated alternatives. Beyond performance, our MAP-based formulation also delivers general guidelines for building more reliable and principled multi-agent systems in the future<br>

Generation of LiDAR-Invisible Objects</a></div></span></div><div id='abs'>Abstract:<br><span id='abs'>LiDAR-based 3D object detectors are fundamental to autonomous driving, where failing to detect objects poses severe safety risks. Developing effective 3D adversarial attacks is essential for thoroughly testing these detection systems and exposing their vulnerabilities before real-world deployment. However, existing adversarial attacks that add optimized perturbations to 3D points have two critical limitations: they rarely cause complete object disappearance and prove difficult to implement in physical environments. We introduce the text-to-3D adversarial generation method, a novel approach enabling physically realizable attacks that can generate 3D models of objects truly invisible to LiDAR detectors and be easily realized in the real world. Specifically, we present the first empirical study that systematically investigates the factors influencing detection vulnerability by manipulating the topology, connectivity, and intensity of individual pedestrian 3D models and combining pedestrians with multiple objects within the CARLA simulation environment. Building on the insights, we propose the physically-informed text-to-3D adversarial generation (Phy3DAdvGen) that systematically optimizes text prompts by iteratively refining verbs, objects, and poses to produce LiDAR-invisible pedestrians. To ensure physical realizability, we construct a comprehensive object pool containing 13 3D models of real objects and constrain Phy3DAdvGen to generate 3D objects based on combinations of objects in this set. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can generate 3D pedestrians that evade six state-of-the-art (SOTA) LiDAR 3D detectors in both CARLA simulation and physical environments, thereby highlighting vulnerabilities in safety-critical applications.<br>

This challenge raises the imperative of a cohesive memory module, which can elevate vanilla LLMs into autonomous reading agents. Despite the emergence of some heuristic approaches, a systematic design principle remains absent. To fill this void, we draw inspiration from Jean Piaget's Constructivist Theory, illuminating three traits of the agentic memory -- structured schemata, flexible assimilation, and dynamic accommodation. This blueprint forges a clear path toward a more robust and efficient memory system for LLM-based reading comprehension. To this end, we develop CAM, a prototype implementation of Constructivist Agentic Memory that simultaneously embodies the structurality, flexibility, and dynamicity. At its core, CAM is endowed with an incremental overlapping clustering algorithm for structured memory development, supporting both coherent hierarchical summarization and online batch integration. During inference, CAM adaptively explores the memory structure to activate query-relevant information for contextual response, akin to the human associative process. Compared to existing approaches, our design demonstrates dual advantages in both performance and efficiency across diverse long-text reading comprehension tasks, including question answering, query-based summarization, and claim verification.<br>

Yet, with the proliferation of models and agentic strategies, practitioners face substantial uncertainty in selecting the best configuration for a downstream task. Prior studies show that different agents and backbones exhibit complementary strengths, and that larger models are not always superior, underscoring the need for adaptive routing mechanisms. Existing approaches to agent routing, however, often emphasize cost efficiency while overlooking the fine-grained contextual and relational structure inherent in QA tasks. In this paper, we propose tAgentRouter, a framework that formulates multi-agent QA as a knowledge-graph-guided routing problem supervised by empirical performance signals. Specifically, we convert QA instance into a knowledge graph that jointly encodes queries, contextual entities, and agents, and then train a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN) to propagate information across node types and produce task-aware routing distributions over agents. By leveraging soft supervision and weighted aggregation of agent outputs, AgentRouter learns principled collaboration schemes that capture the complementary strengths of diverse agents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms single-agent and ensemble baselines, while generalizing across benchmarks and LLM backbones. These results highlight the effectiveness and robustness of graph-supervised multi-agent routing for question answering.<br>

Prior work has shown that LLMs often favor Western-associated entities in Arabic, raising concerns about cultural fairness. Due to the lack of multilingual benchmarks, it remains unclear if such biases also manifest in different non-Western languages. In this paper, we introduce Camellia, a benchmark for measuring entity-centric cultural biases in nine Asian languages spanning six distinct Asian cultures. Camellia includes 19,530 entities manually annotated for association with the specific Asian or Western culture, as well as 2,173 naturally occurring masked contexts for entities derived from social media posts. Using Camellia, we evaluate cultural biases in four recent multilingual LLM families across various tasks such as cultural context adaptation, sentiment association, and entity extractive QA. Our analyses show a struggle by LLMs at cultural adaptation in all Asian languages, with performance differing across models developed in regions with varying access to culturally-relevant data. We further observe that different LLM families hold their distinct biases, differing in how they associate cultures with particular sentiments. Lastly, we find that LLMs struggle with context understanding in Asian languages, creating performance gaps between cultures in entity extraction.<br>

Recent advances have focused on constraint-based causal discovery to solve this problem, and yet in practice these methods often face challenges related to multiple testing and error propagation. These issues could be mitigated by a score-based method and thus it has raised great attention whether there exists a score-based greedy search method that can handle the partially observed scenario. In this work, we propose the first score-based greedy search method for the identification of structure involving latent variables with identifiability guarantees. Specifically, we propose Generalized N Factor Model and establish the global consistency: the true structure including latent variables can be identified up to the Markov equivalence class by using score. We then design Latent variable Greedy Equivalence Search (LGES), a greedy search algorithm for this class of model with well-defined operators, which search very efficiently over the graph space to find the optimal structure. Our experiments on both synthetic and real-life data validate the effectiveness of our method (code will be publicly available).<br>

A Correlation Analysis</a></div></span></div><div id='abs'>Abstract:<br><span id='abs'>Social, also called human-aware, navigation is a key challenge for the integration of mobile robots into human environments. The evaluation of such systems is complex, as factors such as comfort, safety, and legibility must be considered. Human-centered assessments, typically conducted through surveys, provide reliable insights but are costly, resource-intensive, and difficult to reproduce or compare across systems. Alternatively, numerical social navigation metrics are easy to compute and facilitate comparisons, yet the community lacks consensus on a standard set of metrics. This work explores the relationship between numerical metrics and human-centered evaluations to identify potential correlations. If specific quantitative measures align with human perceptions, they could serve as standardized evaluation tools, reducing the dependency on surveys. Our results indicate that while current metrics capture some aspects of robot navigation behavior, important subjective factors remain insufficiently represented and new metrics are necessary.<br>

Diagnosing Reasoning-Execution Gaps in VLM-Powered Mobile-Use Agents</a></div></span></div><div id='abs'>Abstract:<br><span id='abs'>Mobile-use agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) have shown great potential in interpreting natural language instructions and generating corresponding actions based on mobile graphical user interface. Recent studies suggest that incorporating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tends to improve the execution accuracy. However, existing evaluations emphasize execution accuracy while neglecting whether CoT reasoning aligns with ground-truth actions. This oversight fails to assess potential reasoning-execution gaps, which in turn foster over-trust: users relying on seemingly plausible CoTs may unknowingly authorize harmful actions, potentially resulting in financial loss or trust crisis. In this work, we introduce a new evaluation framework to diagnose reasoning-execution gaps. At its core lies Ground-Truth Alignment (GTA), which measures whether the action implied by a CoT matches the ground-truth action. By combining GTA with the standard Exact Match (EM) metric, we jointly assess both the reasoning accuracy and execution accuracy. This joint perspective reveals two types of reasoning-execution gaps: (i) Execution Gap (EG), where the reasoning correctly identifies the correct action but execution fails, and (ii) Reasoning Gap (RG), where execution succeeds but reasoning process conflicts with the actual execution. Experimental results across a wide range of mobile interaction tasks reveal that reasoning-execution gaps are prevalent, with execution gaps occurring more frequently than reasoning gaps. Moreover, while scaling up model size reduces the overall gap, sizable execution gaps persist even in the largest models. Further analysis shows that our framework reliably reflects systematic EG/RG patterns in state-of-the-art models. These findings offer concrete diagnostics and support the development of more trustworthy mobile-use agents.<br>

This raises a natural question: with the advent of strong video foundational models, might they supplant conventional vision encoder paradigms for general-purpose multimodal understanding? While recent studies have begun to explore the potential of world models on common vision tasks, these explorations typically lack a systematic investigation of generic, multimodal tasks. In this work, we strive to investigate the capabilities when world model priors are transferred into Vision-Language Models: we re-purpose a video diffusion model as a generative encoder to perform a single denoising step and treat the resulting latents as a set of visual embedding. We empirically investigate this class of models, which we refer to as World-Language Models (WorldLMs), and we find that generative encoders can capture latents useful for downstream understanding that show distinctions from conventional encoders. Naming our best-performing variant Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA), we further discover that this method significantly enhances spatial reasoning abilities and enables single-image models to perform multi-frame reasoning. Through the curation of a suite of visual reasoning tasks, we find DyVA to surpass both open-source and proprietary baselines, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance. We attribute these gains to WorldLM's inherited motion-consistency internalization from video pre-training. Finally, we systematically explore extensive model designs to highlight promising directions for future work. We hope our study can pave the way for a new family of VLMs that leverage priors from world models and are on a promising path towards generalist vision learners.<br>

However, existing embedding models lack visual-interactive capabilities to specify regions of interest from users (e.g., point, bounding box, mask), which have been explored in generative models to broaden their human-interactive applicability. Equipping embedding models with visual interactions not only would unlock new applications with localized grounding of user intent, which remains unexplored, but also enable the models to learn entity-level information within images to complement their global representations for conventional embedding tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel Visual-InteRactive Text-Image Universal Embedder (VIRTUE) that extends the capabilities of the segmentation model and the vision-language model to the realm of representation learning. In VIRTUE, the segmentation model can process visual prompts that pinpoint specific regions within an image, thereby enabling the embedder to handle complex and ambiguous scenarios more precisely. To evaluate the visual-interaction ability of VIRTUE, we introduce a large-scale Segmentation-and-Scene Caption Retrieval (SCaR) benchmark comprising 1M samples that aims to retrieve the text caption by jointly considering the entity with a specific object and image scene. VIRTUE consistently achieves a state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements across 36 universal MMEB (3.1%-8.5%) and five visual-interactive SCaR (15.2%-20.3%) tasks.<br>

In this paper, we propose \textbf{Agent-ScanKit}, a systematic probing framework to unravel the memory and reasoning capabilities of multimodal agents under controlled perturbations. Specifically, we introduce three orthogonal probing paradigms: visual-guided, text-guided, and structure-guided, each designed to quantify the contributions of memorization and reasoning without requiring access to model internals. In five publicly available GUI benchmarks involving 18 multimodal agents, the results demonstrate that mechanical memorization often outweighs systematic reasoning. Most of the models function predominantly as retrievers of training-aligned knowledge, exhibiting limited generalization.

However, the complex nature of brain activity introduces critical challenges: EEG signals simultaneously encode both cognitive processes and intrinsic neural states, creating a mismatch in EEG paired-data modality that hinders effective cross-modal representation learning. Through a pivot investigation, we uncover complementary relationships between these modalities. Leveraging this insight, we propose mapping EEG signals and their corresponding modalities into a unified semantic space to achieve generalized interpretation. To fully enable conversational capabilities, we further introduce WaveMind-Instruct-338k, the first cross-task EEG dataset for instruction tuning. The resulting model demonstrates robust classification accuracy while supporting flexible, open-ended conversations across four downstream tasks, thereby offering valuable insights for both neuroscience research and the development of general-purpose EEG models.<br>

Existing methods face a major tradeoff: per-scene optimization yields high fidelity but is computationally expensive, whereas feed-forward foundation models enable real-time inference but struggle with accuracy and robustness. In this work, we propose ARTDECO, a unified framework that combines the efficiency of feed-forward models with the reliability of SLAM-based pipelines. ARTDECO uses 3D foundation models for pose estimation and point prediction, coupled with a Gaussian decoder that transforms multi-scale features into structured 3D Gaussians. To sustain both fidelity and efficiency at scale, we design a hierarchical Gaussian representation with a LoD-aware rendering strategy, which improves rendering fidelity while reducing redundancy. Experiments on eight diverse indoor and outdoor benchmarks show that ARTDECO delivers interactive performance comparable to SLAM, robustness similar to feed-forward systems, and reconstruction quality close to per-scene optimization, providing a practical path toward on-the-fly digitization of real-world environments with both accurate geometry and high visual fidelity.

However, the large and complex nature of point clouds creates challenges under bandwidth constraints and intermittent connectivity, often degrading system performance. We propose a deep compression framework based on semantic scene graphs. The method decomposes point clouds into semantically coherent patches and encodes them into compact latent representations with semantic-aware encoders conditioned by Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). A folding-based decoder, guided by latent features and graph node attributes, enables structurally accurate reconstruction. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets show that the framework achieves state-of-the-art compression rates, reducing data size by up to 98% while preserving both structural and semantic fidelity. In addition, it supports downstream applications such as multi-robot pose graph optimization and map merging, achieving trajectory accuracy and map alignment comparable to those obtained with raw LiDAR scans.<br>

Growing application scenarios demand models with streaming inference capabilities. This has created a pressing need for models that are simultaneously fast, lightweight, and high-fidelity. However, existing streaming methods typically rely on either autoregressive (AR) or non-autoregressive (NAR) frameworks, which either require large parameter sizes to achieve strong performance or struggle to generalize to unseen speakers. In this study, we propose MeanVC, a lightweight and streaming zero-shot VC approach. MeanVC introduces a diffusion transformer with a chunk-wise autoregressive denoising strategy, combining the strengths of both AR and NAR paradigms for efficient streaming processing. By introducing mean flows, MeanVC regresses the average velocity field during training, enabling zero-shot VC with superior speech quality and speaker similarity in a single sampling step by directly mapping from the start to the endpoint of the flow trajectory. Additionally, we incorporate diffusion adversarial post-training to mitigate over-smoothing and further enhance speech quality. Experimental results demonstrate that MeanVC significantly outperforms existing zero-shot streaming VC systems, achieving superior conversion quality with higher efficiency and significantly fewer parameters.

Numerous computational costs have been invested in existing well-trained checkpoints, but many of them remain underutilized due to engineering constraints or limited model capacity. To efficiently reuse this "sunk" cost, we propose to recycle pretrained checkpoints by expanding their parameter counts and continuing training. We propose orthogonal growth method well-suited for converged Mixture-of-Experts model: interpositional layer copying for depth growth and expert duplication with injected noise for width growth. To determine the optimal timing for such growth across checkpoints sequences, we perform comprehensive scaling experiments revealing that the final accuracy has a strong positive correlation with the amount of sunk cost, indicating that greater prior investment leads to better performance. We scale our approach to models with 70B parameters and over 1T training tokens, achieving 10.66% accuracy gain over training from scratch under the same additional compute budget. Our checkpoint recycling approach establishes a foundation for economically efficient large language model pretraining.<br>

Despite significant advances in learning-based cardinality estimation methods, most existing approaches remain difficult to generalize to new datasets due to their strong dependence on raw data or queries, thus limiting their practicality in real scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we argue that semantics in the schema may benefit cardinality estimation, and leveraging such semantics may alleviate these dependencies. To this end, we introduce ZeroCard, the first semantics-driven cardinality estimation method that can be applied without any dependence on raw data access, query logs, or retraining on the target database. Specifically, we propose to predict data distributions using schema semantics, thereby avoiding raw data dependence. Then, we introduce a query template-agnostic representation method to alleviate query dependence. Finally, we construct a large-scale query dataset derived from real-world tables and pretrain ZeroCard on it, enabling it to learn cardinality from schema semantics and predicate representations. After pretraining, ZeroCard's parameters can be frozen and applied in an off-the-shelf manner. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the distinct advantages of ZeroCard and show its practical applications in query optimization. Its zero-dependence property significantly facilitates deployment in real-world scenarios.<br>

Early detection of faults is essential to protect the motor and prolong its lifespan. This paper presents a hybrid method that integrates BYOL with CNNs for classifying thermal images of induction motors for fault detection. The thermal dataset used in this work includes different operating states of the motor, such as normal operation, overload, and faults. We employed multiple deep learning (DL) models for the BYOL technique, ranging from popular architectures such as ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, DenseNet-169, EfficientNetB0, VGG16, and MobileNetV2. Additionally, we introduced a new high-performance yet lightweight CNN model named BYOL-IMNet, which comprises four custom-designed blocks tailored for fault classification in thermal images. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BYOL-IMNet achieves 99.89\% test accuracy and an inference time of 5.7 ms per image, outperforming state-of-the-art models. This study highlights the promising performance of the CNN-BYOL hybrid method in enhancing accuracy for detecting faults in induction motors, offering a robust methodology for online monitoring in industrial settings.<br>

These models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in speech-to-speech understanding and generation benchmarks, together with promising scaling laws, primarily enabled by the representational alignment between text and speech. Nevertheless, they suffer from shortcomings, partly owing to the disproportionately longer sequences of speech tokens in contrast to textual tokens. This results in a large compute imbalance between modalities during pre-training as well as during inference, and a potential hindrance to effectively aligning speech and text, ultimately translating to several orders of magnitude slower scaling laws. We introduce the Latent Speech-Text Transformer (LST), which makes pre-training speech-text models more data-efficient by dynamically and inexpensively aggregating speech tokens into latent speech patches. These patches serve as higher-level units that can either align with corresponding textual units to aid capability transfer or even encapsulate common speech sequences like silences to be more compute-efficient. We show that LST outperforms vanilla approaches on speech-to-speech as well as text-to-text benchmarks in both data- and compute-controlled settings, the former indicating more effective representational alignment and the latter indicating steeper scaling laws for speech-text models. On HellaSwag story completion, LST achieves 6.5% absolute gain in speech accuracy under compute-controlled training and 5.3% under data-controlled training, while also improving text performance. We will release our models, code, and the evaluation data to facilitate further research.<br>

The core challenge of RVOS is to anchor abstract linguistic concepts onto a specific set of pixels and continuously segment them through the complex dynamics of a video. Faced with this difficulty, prior work has often decomposed the task into a pragmatic `locate-then-segment' pipeline. However, this cascaded design creates an information bottleneck by simplifying semantics into coarse geometric prompts (e.g, point), and struggles to maintain temporal consistency as the segmenting process is often decoupled from the initial language grounding. To overcome these fundamental limitations, we propose FlowRVS, a novel framework that reconceptualizes RVOS as a conditional continuous flow problem. This allows us to harness the inherent strengths of pretrained T2V models, fine-grained pixel control, text-video semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. Instead of conventional generating from noise to mask or directly predicting mask, we reformulate the task by learning a direct, language-guided deformation from a video's holistic representation to its target mask. Our one-stage, generative approach achieves new state-of-the-art results across all major RVOS benchmarks. Specifically, achieving a $\mathcal{J}\&\mathcal{F}$ of 51.1 in MeViS (+1.6 over prior SOTA) and 73.3 in the zero shot Ref-DAVIS17 (+2.7), demonstrating the significant potential of modeling video understanding tasks as continuous deformation processes.<br>

Traditional detection methods often suffer from low accuracy and poor generalization across different datasets. To overcome these issues, we propose a machine learning-based model that automatically and accurately identifies code smells, offering a scalable solution for software quality analysis. The novelty of our approach lies in the use of eight diverse ML algorithms, including XGBoost, AdaBoost, and other classifiers, alongside key techniques such as the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) for class imbalance and Pearson correlation for efficient feature selection. These methods collectively improve model accuracy and generalization. Our methodology involves several steps: first, we preprocess the data and apply SMOTE to balance the dataset; next, Pearson correlation is used for feature selection to reduce redundancy; followed by training eight ML algorithms and tuning hyperparameters through Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian Optimization. Finally, we evaluate the models using accuracy, F-measure, and confusion matrices. The results show that AdaBoost, Random Forest, and XGBoost perform best, achieving accuracies of 100%, 99%, and 99%, respectively.

Existing safety training methods largely fail to address this vulnerability, due to the inherent difficulty of uncovering hidden triggers implanted in the model. Motivated by recent findings on LLMs' situational awareness, we propose a novel post-training framework that cultivates self-awareness of backdoor risks and enables models to articulate implanted triggers even when they are absent from the prompt. At its core, our approach introduces an inversion-inspired reinforcement learning framework that encourages models to introspectively reason about their own behaviors and reverse-engineer the triggers responsible for misaligned outputs. Guided by curated reward signals, this process transforms a poisoned model into one capable of precisely identifying its implanted trigger. Surprisingly, we observe that such backdoor self-awareness emerges abruptly within a short training window, resembling a phase transition in capability. Building on this emergent property, we further present two complementary defense strategies for mitigating and detecting backdoor threats. Experiments on five backdoor attacks, compared against six baseline methods, demonstrate that our approach has strong potential to improve the robustness of LLMs against backdoor risks.

To address this gap, we curate Human Behavior Atlas, a unified benchmark of diverse behavioral tasks designed to support the development of unified models for understanding psychological and social behaviors. Human Behavior Atlas comprises over 100,000 samples spanning text, audio, and visual modalities, covering tasks on affective states, cognitive states, pathologies, and social processes. Our unification efforts can reduce redundancy and cost, enable training to scale efficiently across tasks, and enhance generalization of behavioral features across domains. On Human Behavior Atlas, we train three models: OmniSapiens-7B SFT, OmniSapiens-7B BAM, and OmniSapiens-7B RL. We show that training on Human Behavior Atlas enables models to consistently outperform existing multimodal LLMs across diverse behavioral tasks. Pretraining on Human Behavior Atlas also improves transfer to novel behavioral datasets; with the targeted use of behavioral descriptors yielding meaningful performance gains.<br>

Yet, existing safety benchmarks rarely test vulnerabilities in domains such as political manipulation, propaganda and disinformation generation, or surveillance and information control. We introduce SocialHarmBench, a dataset of 585 prompts spanning 7 sociopolitical categories and 34 countries, designed to surface where LLMs most acutely fail in politically charged contexts. Our evaluations reveal several shortcomings: open-weight models exhibit high vulnerability to harmful compliance, with Mistral-7B reaching attack success rates as high as 97% to 98% in domains such as historical revisionism, propaganda, and political manipulation. Moreover, temporal and geographic analyses show that LLMs are most fragile when confronted with 21st-century or pre-20th-century contexts, and when responding to prompts tied to regions such as Latin America, the USA, and the UK. These findings demonstrate that current safeguards fail to generalize to high-stakes sociopolitical settings, exposing systematic biases and raising concerns about the reliability of LLMs in preserving human rights and democratic values. We share the SocialHarmBench benchmark at https://huggingface.co/datasets/psyonp/SocialHarmBench.<br>

Existing PCGRL research focuses on single generator agents, but are bottlenecked by the need to frequently recalculate heuristics of level quality and the agent's need to navigate around potentially large maps. By framing level generation as a multi-agent problem, we mitigate the efficiency bottleneck of single-agent PCGRL by reducing the number of reward calculations relative to the number of agent actions. We also find that multi-agent level generators are better able to generalize to out-of-distribution map shapes, which we argue is due to the generators' learning more local, modular design policies. We conclude that treating content generation as a distributed, multi-agent task is beneficial for generating functional artifacts at scale.<br>

A key challenge is generating CEs that are robust against various perturbation types (e.g. input and model perturbations) while simultaneously satisfying other desirable properties. These include plausibility, ensuring CEs reside on the data manifold, and diversity, providing multiple distinct recourse options for single inputs. Existing methods, however, mostly struggle to address these multifaceted requirements in a unified, model-agnostic manner. We address these limitations by proposing a novel generative framework. First, we introduce the Label-conditional Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (L-GMVAE), a model trained to learn a structured latent space where each class label is represented by a set of Gaussian components with diverse, prototypical centroids. Building on this, we present LAPACE (LAtent PAth Counterfactual Explanations), a model-agnostic algorithm that synthesises entire paths of CE points by interpolating from inputs' latent representations to those learned latent centroids. This approach inherently ensures robustness to input changes, as all paths for a given target class converge to the same fixed centroids. Furthermore, the generated paths provide a spectrum of recourse options, allowing users to navigate the trade-off between proximity and plausibility while also encouraging robustness against model changes. In addition, user-specified actionability constraints can also be easily incorporated via lightweight gradient optimisation through the L-GMVAE's decoder. Comprehensive experiments show that LAPACE is computationally efficient and achieves competitive performance across eight quantitative metrics.<br>

However, most current approaches address these tasks separately rather than through a unified framework. This work aims to integrate these two tasks into one unified model. Although discrete speech tokenization enables joint modeling, its inherent information loss limits performance in both recognition and generation. In this work, we present UniVoice, a unified LLM framework through continuous representations that seamlessly integrates speech recognition and synthesis within a single model. Our approach combines the strengths of autoregressive modeling for speech recognition with flow matching for high-quality generation. To mitigate the inherent divergence between autoregressive and flow-matching models, we further design a dual attention mechanism, which switches between a causal mask for recognition and a bidirectional attention mask for synthesis. Furthermore, the proposed text-prefix-conditioned speech infilling method enables high-fidelity zero-shot voice cloning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve or exceed current single-task modeling methods in both ASR and zero-shot TTS tasks.

However, LLM's autoregressive decoding may limit the ability to revisit and refine earlier tokens in a holistic manner, which can also lead to inefficient exploration for diverse solutions. In this paper, we propose LaDiR (Latent Diffusion Reasoner), a novel reasoning framework that unifies the expressiveness of continuous latent representation with the iterative refinement capabilities of latent diffusion models for an existing LLM. We first construct a structured latent reasoning space using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that encodes text reasoning steps into blocks of thought tokens, preserving semantic information and interpretability while offering compact but expressive representations. Subsequently, we utilize a latent diffusion model that learns to denoise a block of latent thought tokens with a blockwise bidirectional attention mask, enabling longer horizon and iterative refinement with adaptive test-time compute. This design allows efficient parallel generation of diverse reasoning trajectories, allowing the model to plan and revise the reasoning process holistically. We conduct evaluations on a suite of mathematical reasoning and planning benchmarks. Empirical results show that LaDiR consistently improves accuracy, diversity, and interpretability over existing autoregressive, diffusion-based, and latent reasoning methods, revealing a new paradigm for text reasoning with latent diffusion.<br>

This capability is especially vital for world simulation related tasks. In this paper, we present ChronoEdit, a framework that reframes image editing as a video generation problem. First, ChronoEdit treats the input and edited images as the first and last frames of a video, allowing it to leverage large pretrained video generative models that capture not only object appearance but also the implicit physics of motion and interaction through learned temporal consistency. Second, ChronoEdit introduces a temporal reasoning stage that explicitly performs editing at inference time. Under this setting, the target frame is jointly denoised with reasoning tokens to imagine a plausible editing trajectory that constrains the solution space to physically viable transformations. The reasoning tokens are then dropped after a few steps to avoid the high computational cost of rendering a full video. To validate ChronoEdit, we introduce PBench-Edit, a new benchmark of image-prompt pairs for contexts that require physical consistency, and demonstrate that ChronoEdit surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both visual fidelity and physical plausibility. Code and models for both the 14B and 2B variants of ChronoEdit will be released on the project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/chronoedit<br>

However, most ML-based forecast models treat reanalysis as the truth and are trained under variable-specific loss weighting, ignoring their physical coupling and spatial structure. Over long time horizons, the forecasts become blurry and physically unrealistic under rollout training. To address this, we reinterpret model training as a weak-constraint four-dimensional variational data assimilation (WC-4DVar) problem, treating reanalysis data as imperfect observations. This allows the loss function to incorporate reanalysis error covariance and capture multivariate dependencies. In practice, we compute the loss in a latent space learned by an autoencoder (AE), where the reanalysis error covariance becomes approximately diagonal, thus avoiding the need to explicitly model it in the high-dimensional model space. We show that rollout training with latent-space constraints improves long-term forecast skill and better preserves fine-scale structures and physical realism compared to training with model-space loss. Finally, we extend this framework to accommodate heterogeneous data sources, enabling the forecast model to be trained jointly on reanalysis and multi-source observations within a unified theoretical formulation.<br>

Time series, as a fundamental modality in scientific data, presents unique challenges that are often overlooked in current multimodal LLMs, which either encode numerical sequences as text or convert them into images. Such approaches may be insufficient for comprehensive scientific time series understanding and generation. Existing unified time series models typically specialise in either forecasting or analysis, and their effectiveness on non-periodic, heterogeneous scientific signals remains unclear. To address these gaps, we introduce SciTS, a benchmark spanning 12 scientific domains and 43 tasks, with over 50k+ instances, both univariate and multivariate signals ranging from $10^0$ to $10^7$ in length and up to 10~MHz in frequency. We benchmark 17 models, including text-only LLMs, multimodal LLMs, and unified time series models, and find that general-purpose LLMs exhibit stronger generalisability than specialised time series models, while representing time series as text or images limits their performance due to excessively long sequences and loss of numerical precision, respectively. We then introduce TimeOmni, a framework that equips LLMs with the ability to understand and generate time series while remaining compatible with general-purpose LLM training. This work fills a gap in both dedicated benchmarks and modelling frameworks for scientific time series, paving the way for LLMs to understand and generate complex temporal scientific data.<br>

In this setting, speculative decoding can facilitate collaborative inference of models distributively deployed: an on-device draft model locally generates drafts and a remote server-based target model verifies and corrects them, resulting lower latency. However, unlike autoregressive text generation, behavior cloning policies, typically used for embodied AI applications like robot manipulation and autonomous driving, cannot parallelize verification and correction for multiple drafts as each action depends on observation which needs to be updated by a previous action. To this end, we propose Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference, wherein the draft model estimates an action's need for verification and correction by the target model and selectively skips communication and computation for server operations. Action deviation shows a strong correlation with action's rejection probability by the target model, enabling selective skipping. We derive the path deviation threshold that balances the transmission rate and the inference performance, and we empirically show that action deviation-aware hybrid inference reduces uplink transmission and server operation by 40%, while lowering end-to-end latency by 33.32% relative to hybrid inference without skipping and achieving task success rate up to 97.03% of that of target model only inference.<br>

To minimize data dependency, we introduce two novel mechanisms grounded in self-awareness: (1) self-aware difficulty prediction, where the model learns to assess task difficulty relative to its own abilities and prioritize challenging yet solvable tasks, and (2) self-aware limit breaking, where the model recognizes when a task is beyond its capability boundary and proactively requests external data to break through that limit.

This creates an 'information void' where semantic information that could be inferred from unmasked tokens is lost between denoising steps. We introduce Continuously Augmented Discrete Diffusion (CADD), a framework that augments the discrete state space with a paired diffusion in a continuous latent space. This yields graded, gradually corrupted states in which masked tokens are represented by noisy yet informative latent vectors rather than collapsed 'information voids'. At each reverse step, CADD may leverage the continuous latent as a semantic hint to guide discrete denoising. The design is clean and compatible with existing discrete diffusion training. At sampling time, the strength and choice of estimator for the continuous latent vector enables a controlled trade-off between mode-coverage (generating diverse outputs) and mode-seeking (generating contextually precise outputs) behaviors.

Existing methods struggle with this: single-agent systems are quickly overwhelmed by large, heterogeneous files in the large data lakes, while multi-agent systems designed based on a master-slave paradigm depend on a rigid central controller for task allocation that requires precise knowledge of each sub-agent's capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multi-agent communication paradigm inspired by the blackboard architecture for traditional AI models. In this framework, a central agent posts requests to a shared blackboard, and autonomous subordinate agents -- either responsible for a partition of the data lake or general information retrieval -- volunteer to respond based on their capabilities. This design improves scalability and flexibility by eliminating the need for a central coordinator to have prior knowledge of all sub-agents' expertise. We evaluate our method on three benchmarks that require explicit data discovery: KramaBench and modified versions of DS-Bench and DA-Code to incorporate data discovery. Experimental results demonstrate that the blackboard architecture substantially outperforms baselines, including RAG and the master-slave multi-agent paradigm, achieving between 13% to 57% relative improvement in end-to-end task success and up to a 9% relative gain in F1 score for data discovery over the best-performing baselines across both proprietary and open-source LLMs. Our findings establish the blackboard paradigm as a scalable and generalizable communication framework for multi-agent systems.<br>

Understanding software defects in multi-user XR systems is crucial for enhancing system reliability, yet remains underexplored. To fill the gap, this paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of multi-user XR defects, analyzing 2,649 real-world bug reports from diverse sources, including developer forums, GitHub repositories, and app reviews on mainstream XR app stores. Through rigorous qualitative analysis using iterative open coding, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy that classifies multi-user XR bugs along three dimensions: Symptom Manifestation, Root Cause Origin, and Consequence Severity. Our findings reveal that synchronization inconsistencies and avatar-related anomalies are the most prevalent symptoms, while network/synchronization logic defects and session management flaws emerge as dominant root causes. Critically, over 34% of analyzed bugs lead to severe consequences that fundamentally break the shared experience, including system crashes, persistent disconnections, and complete interaction breakdowns, etc. We also identify concerning privacy and health implications unique to multi-user XR contexts. Based on our findings of defect analysis, we provide actionable recommendations for developers, platform vendors, and researchers. Our results demonstrate that multi-user XR systems face distinct challenges at the intersection of distributed systems, real-time 3D interaction, and immersive experiences, necessitating specialized approaches to testing, debugging, and quality assurance.<br>

In this work, we explore how to learn compact representations of LLM abilities that can facilitate downstream tasks, such as model routing and performance prediction on new benchmarks. We frame this problem as estimating the probability that a given model will correctly answer a specific query. Inspired by the item response theory (IRT) in psychometrics, we model this probability as a function of three key factors: (i) the model's multi-skill ability vector, (2) the query's discrimination vector that separates models of differing skills, and (3) the query's difficulty scalar. To learn these parameters jointly, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network that couples model- and query-level embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach leads to state-of-the-art performance in both model routing and benchmark accuracy prediction. Moreover, analysis validates that the learned parameters encode meaningful, interpretable information about model capabilities and query characteristics.<br>

While methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers are effective, there is still room for improvement in modeling the highly complex and non-linear nature of forgery artifacts. To address this issue, we propose a novel detection method based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). By replacing fixed activation functions with learnable splines, our KAN-based approach is better suited to this challenge. Furthermore, to guide the network's focus towards critical facial areas, we introduce a Landmark-assisted Adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (LAKAN) module. This module uses facial landmarks as a structural prior to dynamically generate the internal parameters of the KAN, creating an instance-specific signal that steers a general-purpose image encoder towards the most informative facial regions with artifacts. This core innovation creates a powerful combination between geometric priors and the network's learning process.

Yet training them without skip (residual) connections remains notoriously difficult. While skips stabilize optimization, they also disrupt the hierarchical structure of representations, raising the long-standing question of whether transformers can be trained efficiently without them. In this work, we address this problem by analyzing the Jacobian of a skipless transformer block, showing why skips improve conditioning and revealing that their stabilization benefits can be recovered through a principled initialization strategy. Building on this insight, we introduce the first method that enables stable and efficient training of skipless transformers without altering the standard architecture. We validate our approach on Vision Transformers (ViTs) in both supervised and self-supervised settings, demonstrating that skipless ViTs trained with our initialization overcome the usual optimization barriers, learn richer hierarchical representations, and outperform strong baselines, that incorporate skip connections, on dense prediction benchmarks. These results show that skip connections are not a fundamental requirement for training ViTs and open new avenues for hierarchical representation learning in vision models.<br>

However, their reliability is limited by a foundational issue: they are trained on discrete preference labels, forcing a single ground truth onto tasks that are often subjective, ambiguous, or nuanced. We argue that a reliable autorater must learn to model the full distribution of preferences defined by a target population. In this paper, we propose a general framework for calibrating probabilistic autoraters to any given preference distribution. We formalize the problem and present two learning methods tailored to different data conditions: 1) a direct supervised fine-tuning for dense, probabilistic labels, and 2) a reinforcement learning approach for sparse, binary labels. Our empirical results show that finetuning autoraters with a distribution-matching objective leads to verbalized probability predictions that are better aligned with the target preference distribution, with improved calibration and significantly lower positional bias, all while preserving performance on objective tasks.<br>

Yet, relying solely on text instructions limits fine-grained control over the extent of edits. We introduce Kontinuous Kontext, an instruction-driven editing model that provides a new dimension of control over edit strength, enabling users to adjust edits gradually from no change to a fully realized result in a smooth and continuous manner. Kontinuous Kontext extends a state-of-the-art image editing model to accept an additional input, a scalar edit strength which is then paired with the edit instruction, enabling explicit control over the extent of the edit. To inject this scalar information, we train a lightweight projector network that maps the input scalar and the edit instruction to coefficients in the model's modulation space. For training our model, we synthesize a diverse dataset of image-edit-instruction-strength quadruplets using existing generative models, followed by a filtering stage to ensure quality and consistency. Kontinuous Kontext provides a unified approach for fine-grained control over edit strength for instruction driven editing from subtle to strong across diverse operations such as stylization, attribute, material, background, and shape changes, without requiring attribute-specific training.<br>

However, their generalization capability and reconstruction accuracy are still limited while reconstructing driving scenes, which results from two aspects: (1) The fixed view transformation fails when the camera configuration changes, limiting the generalization capability across different driving scenes equipped with different camera configurations. (2) The small overlapping regions between sparse views of the $360^\circ$ panorama and the complexity of driving scenes increase the learning difficulty, reducing the reconstruction accuracy. To handle these difficulties, we propose \textbf{XYZCylinder}, a feedforward model based on a unified cylinder lifting method which involves camera modeling and feature lifting. Specifically, to improve the generalization capability, we design a Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) strategy, which avoids the learning of viewpoint-dependent spatial correspondence and unifies different camera configurations with adjustable parameters. To improve the reconstruction accuracy, we propose a hybrid representation with several dedicated modules based on newly designed Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) to lift 2D image features to 3D space. Experimental results show that XYZCylinder achieves state-of-the-art performance under different evaluation settings, and can be generalized to other driving scenes in a zero-shot manner.

Instruction-based editing relies solely on language instructions, which often fail to capture specific editing details, making reference images necessary. Meanwhile, subject-driven generation is limited to combining concrete objects or people, overlooking broader, abstract concepts. To address these challenges, we propose two novel tasks: multimodal instruction-based editing and generation. These tasks support both text and image instructions and extend the scope to include both concrete and abstract concepts, greatly enhancing their practical applications. We introduce DreamOmni2, tackling two primary challenges: data creation and model framework design. Our data synthesis pipeline consists of three steps: (1) using a feature mixing method to create extraction data for both abstract and concrete concepts, (2) generating multimodal instruction-based editing training data using the editing and extraction models, and (3) further applying the extraction model to create training data for multimodal instruction-based editing. For the framework, to handle multi-image input, we propose an index encoding and position encoding shift scheme, which helps the model distinguish images and avoid pixel confusion. Additionally, we introduce joint training with the VLM and our generation/editing model to better process complex instructions. In addition, we have proposed comprehensive benchmarks for these two new tasks to drive their development. Experiments show that DreamOmni2 has achieved impressive results.

Given a task, the typical AI-driven approach is (i) to generate a set of diverse solutions, and then (ii) to verify these solutions and select one that solves the problem. Crucially, this approach assumes the existence of a reliable verifier, i.e., one that can accurately determine whether a solution solves the given problem. We argue that systems research, long focused on designing and evaluating new performance-oriented algorithms, is particularly well-suited for AI-driven solution discovery. This is because system performance problems naturally admit reliable verifiers: solutions are typically implemented in real systems or simulators, and verification reduces to running these software artifacts against predefined workloads and measuring performance. We term this approach as AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS), which iteratively generates, evaluates, and refines solutions. Using penEvolve, an existing open-source ADRS instance, we present case studies across diverse domains, including load balancing for multi-region cloud scheduling, Mixture-of-Experts inference, LLM-based SQL queries, and transaction scheduling. In multiple instances, ADRS discovers algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art human designs (e.g., achieving up to 5.0x runtime improvements or 50% cost reductions). We distill best practices for guiding algorithm evolution, from prompt design to evaluator construction, for existing frameworks. We then discuss the broader implications for the systems community: as AI assumes a central role in algorithm design, we argue that human researchers will increasingly focus on problem formulation and strategic guidance. Our results highlight both the disruptive potential and the urgent need to adapt systems research practices in the age of AI.<br>

Specifically, the query image undergoes feature extraction, recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages, ultimately presenting the user with semantically similar products that meet their preferences. This multi-view representation discrepancy of the same object in the query and the optimization objective collide across these stages, making it difficult to achieve Pareto optimality in both user experience and conversion. In this paper, an end-to-end generative framework, OneVision, is proposed to address these problems. OneVision builds on VRQ, a vision-aligned residual quantization encoding, which can align the vastly different representations of an object across multiple viewpoints while preserving the distinctive features of each product as much as possible. Then a multi-stage semantic alignment scheme is adopted to maintain strong visual similarity priors while effectively incorporating user-specific information for personalized preference generation. In offline evaluations, OneVision performs on par with online MCA, while improving inference efficiency by 21% through dynamic pruning. In A/B tests, it achieves significant online improvements: +2.15% item CTR, +2.27% CVR, and +3.12% order volume. These results demonstrate that a semantic ID centric, generative architecture can unify retrieval and personalization while simplifying the serving pathway.<br>

Specifically, we train a plug-and-play global planner through a two-step process: we first synthesize high-quality plans from an advanced LLM using our proposed homologous consensus filtering strategy, and apply fine-tuning as a cold start. Moreover, we further improve the planner with a rule-based reinforcement learning stage using a novel executor capability gain reward, ensuring it can handle task instructions of varying difficulty. Experiments on three long-horizon agent tasks show that executor agents equipped with our planner outperform existing methods, achieving new state-of-the-art performance.

Infrequent communication strategies (e.g., Local SGD) reduce this overhead but, when applied to adaptive optimizers, often suffer a performance gap relative to fully synchronous DDP. We trace this gap to a time-scale mismatch: the optimizer's fast-moving momentum, tuned for frequent updates, decays too quickly to smooth gradients over long intervals, leading to noise-dominated optimization. To address this, we propose MT-DAO, a family of optimizers that employs multiple slow- and fast-moving first momenta or the gradient to track update dynamics across different time scales, for which we provide the first convergence guarantees. Empirically, for language-model pre-training, this eliminates the performance gap with DDP, outperforming infrequent-communication baselines in perplexity and reducing iso-token wall-clock time by 6-27% on Ethernet interconnects. At the 720M scale, MT-DAO reaches a target perplexity in 24% fewer steps and 35% less time than the single-momentum DDP baseline. MT-DAO enables effective cross-datacenter training and training over wide geographic areas.<br>

This architectural bottleneck results in high latency, poor runtime adaptability, and inefficient resource allocation, making them impractical for interactive applications. To overcome this, we introduce FlashResearch, a novel framework for efficient deep research that transforms sequential processing into parallel, runtime orchestration by dynamically decomposing complex queries into tree-structured sub-tasks. Our core contributions are threefold: (1) an adaptive planner that dynamically allocates computational resources by determining research breadth and depth based on query complexity; (2) a real-time orchestration layer that monitors research progress and prunes redundant paths to reallocate resources and optimize efficiency; and (3) a multi-dimensional parallelization framework that enables concurrency across both research breadth and depth. Experiments show that FlashResearch consistently improves final report quality within fixed time budgets, and can deliver up to a 5x speedup while maintaining comparable quality.<br>

Two properties are especially desirable: disentanglement, where changing one attribute does not unintentionally alter others, and continuous control, where the strength of an edit can be smoothly adjusted. We introduce a method for disentangled and continuous editing through token-level manipulation of text embeddings. The edits are applied by manipulating the embeddings along carefully chosen directions, which control the strength of the target attribute. To identify such directions, we employ a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE), whose sparse latent space exposes semantically isolated dimensions. Our method operates directly on text embeddings without modifying the diffusion process, making it model agnostic and broadly applicable to various image synthesis backbones. Experiments show that it enables intuitive and efficient manipulations with continuous control across diverse attributes and domains.<br>

However, it remains difficult to provide instant and reliable quantitative assessments of intermediate reasoning step quality, and extensive path exploration is computationally costly. To address this, we propose Mutual Information Tree Search (MITS), a novel framework that guides reasoning with information-theoretic principles. MITS introduces an effective scoring function based on pointwise mutual information (PMI), which enables step-wise evaluation of reasoning paths and search tree expansion via beam search without expensive look-ahead simulations, achieving superior reasoning performances while maintaining computational efficiency. The framework is complemented by an entropy-based dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively allocates computational resources to uncertain reasoning steps where exploration is most beneficial. For final prediction, MITS employs a weighted voting scheme that combines PMI scores with prediction consensus. Through comprehensive experiments on diverse reasoning benchmarks, MITS consistently surpasses baseline methods, establishing a principled and efficient framework for LLM reasoning.<br>

Global pruning achieves strong performance but requires $\mathcal{O}(N)$ memory, which is infeasible for billion-parameter models. Local pruning reduces GPU memory usage to that of a single layer by pruning layers independently, but it neglects inter-layer dependencies and often leads to suboptimal performance in high-sparsity regimes. Unlike unstructured pruning, structured pruning produces regular sparsity patterns that align well with GPU kernels and library optimizations, making it more hardware-efficient. However, structured pruning typically relies on global pruning, since structured patterns are more prone to severe performance degradation under local optimization. To jointly achieve structured pruning and the memory efficiency of local pruning, we propose a divide-and-conquer strategy that decomposes the global pruning problem into coordinated subproblems across different modules, each of which fits within limited GPU memory. Building on this idea, we design \textbf{STRUPRUNE}, an ADMM-based framework that integrates structured sparsity into the pruning process, combining the memory efficiency of local pruning with the hardware compatibility of structured methods. We derive a closed-form analytical solution for structured pruning masks that provides an explicit rule for layer-wise sparsity allocation, and further develop an energy-based asymptotic framework yielding a softmax-form allocation scheme that simplifies optimization while adapting to heterogeneous layer importance. Experiments demonstrate that STRUPRUNE matches the perplexity of global structured pruning while reducing memory cost from $\mathcal{O}(N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$, enabling practical deployment at the billion-parameter scale.<br>

This paper introduces Retrv-R1, the first R1-style MLLM specifically designed for multimodal universal retrieval, achieving higher performance by employing step-by-step reasoning to produce more accurate retrieval results. We find that directly applying the methods of DeepSeek-R1 to retrieval tasks is not feasible, mainly due to (1) the high computational cost caused by the large token consumption required for multiple candidates with reasoning processes, and (2) the instability and suboptimal results when directly applying RL to train for retrieval tasks. To address these issues, Retrv-R1 introduces an information compression module with a details inspection mechanism, which enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens while ensuring that critical information for challenging candidates is preserved. Furthermore, a new training paradigm is proposed, including an activation stage using a retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset for more effective optimization, followed by RL with a novel curriculum reward to improve both performance and efficiency. Incorporating these novel designs, Retrv-R1 achieves SOTA performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization ability, as demonstrated by experiments across multiple benchmarks and tasks.<br>

These agents typically select tools from growing databases or marketplaces to solve user tasks, creating implicit competition among tool providers and developers for visibility and usage. In this paper, we show that this selection process harbors a critical vulnerability: by iteratively manipulating tool names and descriptions, adversaries can systematically bias agents toward selecting specific tools, gaining unfair advantage over equally capable alternatives. We present ToolTweak, a lightweight automatic attack that increases selection rates from a baseline of around 20% to as high as 81%, with strong transferability between open-source and closed-source models. Beyond individual tools, we show that such attacks cause distributional shifts in tool usage, revealing risks to fairness, competition, and security in emerging tool ecosystems. To mitigate these risks, we evaluate two defenses: paraphrasing and perplexity filtering, which reduce bias and lead agents to select functionally similar tools more equally.

For independent refinement, our Semantic Refinement Tool (SRT) corrects abstract object relationships, while the Physical Refinement Tool (PRT) resolves concrete spatial issues via a grid-matching algorithm. For collaborative refinement, a multi-agent framework intelligently orchestrates these tools, featuring a planner for placement rules, a designer for initial layouts, and an evaluator for assessment.

We introduce Benchmark Profiling, a diagnostic framework that decomposes benchmark performance into ten cognitively grounded abilities. The method combines gradient-based importance scoring with targeted parameter ablation to compute an Ability Impact Score (AIS) that quantifies how much each ability contributes to a model's success on a given benchmark. Profiling three instruction-tuned models across ten widely used benchmarks yields four key findings: (i) most benchmarks draw on several abilities rather than one, (ii) datasets with similar labels rely on distinct ability mixtures, (iii) code-generation benchmarks reward broad, multi-skill improvement and thus show only modest gains from narrow domain-specific fine-tuning, and (iv) abilities irrelevant to the task could negatively affect performance. Benchmark Profiling therefore explains why performance gains do not always translate into user-perceived competence and offers a transparent tool for benchmark audit and model interpretability.<br>

This raises a critical point concerning fairness: if selection is systematically biased, it can degrade user experience and distort competition by privileging some providers over others. We introduce a benchmark of diverse tool categories, each containing multiple functionally equivalent tools, to evaluate tool-selection bias. Using this benchmark, we test seven models and show that unfairness exists with models either fixating on a single provider or disproportionately preferring earlier-listed tools in context. To investigate the origins of this bias, we conduct controlled experiments examining tool features, metadata (name, description, parameters), and pre-training exposure. We find that: (1) semantic alignment between queries and metadata is the strongest predictor of choice; (2) perturbing descriptions significantly shifts selections; and (3) repeated pre-training exposure to a single endpoint amplifies bias. Finally, we propose a lightweight mitigation that first filters the candidate tools to a relevant subset and then samples uniformly, reducing bias while preserving good task coverage.

We propose ReSplat, a feed-forward recurrent Gaussian splatting model that iteratively refines 3D Gaussians without explicitly computing gradients. Our key insight is that the Gaussian splatting rendering error serves as a rich feedback signal, guiding the recurrent network to learn effective Gaussian updates. This feedback signal naturally adapts to unseen data distributions at test time, enabling robust generalization. To initialize the recurrent process, we introduce a compact reconstruction model that operates in a $16 \times$ subsampled space, producing $16 \times$ fewer Gaussians than previous per-pixel Gaussian models. This substantially reduces computational overhead and allows for efficient Gaussian updates. Extensive experiments across varying of input views (2, 8, 16), resolutions ($256 \times 256$ to $540 \times 960$), and datasets (DL3DV and RealEstate10K) demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing the number of Gaussians and improving the rendering speed.

While recent approaches leverage SMPL estimation and SMPL-conditioned image generative models to hallucinate novel views, they suffer from inaccurate 3D priors estimated from SMPL meshes and have difficulty in handling difficult human poses and reconstructing fine details. In this paper, we propose SyncHuman, a novel framework that combines 2D multiview generative model and 3D native generative model for the first time, enabling high-quality clothed human mesh reconstruction from single-view images even under challenging human poses. Multiview generative model excels at capturing fine 2D details but struggles with structural consistency, whereas 3D native generative model generates coarse yet structurally consistent 3D shapes. By integrating the complementary strengths of these two approaches, we develop a more effective generation framework. Specifically, we first jointly fine-tune the multiview generative model and the 3D native generative model with proposed pixel-aligned 2D-3D synchronization attention to produce geometrically aligned 3D shapes and 2D multiview images. To further improve details, we introduce a feature injection mechanism that lifts fine details from 2D multiview images onto the aligned 3D shapes, enabling accurate and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SyncHuman achieves robust and photo-realistic 3D human reconstruction, even for images with challenging poses. Our method outperforms baseline methods in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity, demonstrating a promising direction for future 3D generation models.<br>

Query-aware page-level sparse decoding can achieve state-of-the-art performance under constrained FLOPs budgets, but is limited by both sequential-dependent page filtering and coarse-grained token selection, hampering serving efficiency and model performance on TTS tasks under high concurrency and long CoT scenarios (consuming even higher runtime than the forward pipeline itself). In this paper, we first find that the current-step query state can be accurately approximated in a unified manner from a short window of recent queries, enabling training-free query-aware sparsity without waiting in the decoding loop. We propose AsyncSpade, an asynchronous framework for efficient TTS built on two core components: (1) a novel light-weight temporal-regressive module that predicts the next-token query state; (2) an asynchronous and disaggregated framework that decouples the KV cache filtering from the auto-regressive decoding loop, overlapping the token-level KV selection with the forward inference computation through asynchronism. To our knowledge, AsyncSpade is the first to eliminate the sequential dependence without sacrificing model performance. We validate the effectiveness of AsyncSpade on common LLM serving setups with an A100 node, where AsyncSpade fully overlaps KV-cache operations with the inference pipeline, achieving theoretical optimal time-per-output-token (TPOT). Specifically, AsyncSpade delivers over 20% reduction on TPOT compared to SoTA baseline (i.e. Quest) and at least 50% TPOT reduction compared to full attention on Qwen3-8B and Qwen3-32B models, while matching or surpassing their accuracy on various TTS benchmarks (AIME-24/25, GPQA-Diamond, MATH-500).<br>

Existing approaches typically follow the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) paradigm: first retrieving subgraphs relevant to the query and then generating answers conditioned on the retrieved subgraphs. However, such two-phase pipelines often struggle to faithfully incorporate graph structure, since the generation process is ultimately constrained by the quality and completeness of the retrieved subgraph. Although many advanced retrievers have been proposed recently to mitigate this issue, they are usually tailored to the training graphs and generalize poorly to unseen graphs, which limits their practical applicability. In this work, we propose Reasoning by Exploration (RoE), a novel approach that unifies retrieval and generation by framing reasoning over graphs as a process of graph exploration. At each step, the LLM selects candidate nodes and edges to explore, gradually constructing reasoning paths and generating answers along the way. To enable effective exploration, RoE is trained in two stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on gold reasoning paths, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance exploration effectiveness and generalization. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that RoE achieves substantial overall improvements over baselines, while also generalizing effectively to unseen graphs.<br>

This limitation results in reasoning divergence, where models often overlook critical rule dependencies essential for accurate interpretation. Although existing approaches such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have shown promise, they lack systematic methodologies for structured rule processing and are particularly susceptible to error propagation through sequential reasoning chains. To address these limitations, we propose the Dynamic Adjudication Template (DAT), a novel framework inspired by expert human reasoning processes. DAT structures the inference mechanism into three methodical stages: qualitative analysis, evidence gathering, and adjudication. During the qualitative analysis phase, the model comprehensively evaluates the contextual landscape. The subsequent evidence gathering phase involves the targeted extraction of pertinent information based on predefined template elements ([placeholder]), followed by systematic verification against applicable rules. Finally, in the adjudication phase, the model synthesizes these validated components to formulate a comprehensive judgment. Empirical results demonstrate that DAT consistently outperforms conventional CoT approaches in complex rule-based tasks. Notably, DAT enables smaller language models to match, and in some cases exceed, the performance of significantly larger LLMs, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness in managing intricate rule systems.<br>

Although a convergence rate of $T^{-1}$ has long been established since Nemirovski's mirror-prox algorithm and Nesterov's excessive gap technique in the early 2000s, the most effective paradigm in practice is *counterfactual regret minimization*, which is based on *regret matching* and its modern variants. In particular, the state of the art across most benchmarks is *predictive* regret matching$^+$ (PRM$^+$), in conjunction with non-uniform averaging. Yet, such algorithms can exhibit slower $Ω(T^{-1/2})$ convergence even in self-play. In this paper, we close the gap between theory and practice. We propose a new scale-invariant and parameter-free variant of PRM$^+$, which we call IREG-PRM$^+$. We show that it achieves $T^{-1/2}$ best-iterate and $T^{-1}$ (i.e., optimal) average-iterate convergence guarantees, while also being on par with PRM$^+$ on benchmark games. From a technical standpoint, we draw an analogy between IREG-PRM$^+$ and optimistic gradient descent with *adaptive* learning rate. The basic flaw of PRM$^+$ is that the ($\ell_2$-)norm of the regret vector -- which can be thought of as the inverse of the learning rate -- can decrease. By contrast, we design IREG-PRM$^+$ so as to maintain the invariance that the norm of the regret vector is nondecreasing. This enables us to derive an RVU-type bound for IREG-PRM$^+$, the first such property that does not rely on introducing additional hyperparameters to enforce smoothness. Furthermore, we find that IREG-PRM$^+$ performs on par with an adaptive version of optimistic gradient descent that we introduce whose learning rate depends on the misprediction error, demystifying the effectiveness of the regret matching family *vis-a-vis* more standard optimization techniques.<br>

Although it is an effective way of scaling inference time, it often struggles to generate diverse solution candidates, frequently relying on the same underlying approach to solve the problem and thus producing redundant samples. To address this limitation, we propose a new inference algorithm, GuidedSampling, which decouples the exploration and generation phases during inference, increasing diversity of generated candidate solutions. The exploration phase identifies multiple concepts that can be utilized to solve the problem, while the generation phase applies a specific concept to provide final solution candidates. We first define the theoretical bounds of GuidedSampling and then empirically demonstrate that it improves the performance of base model at pass@50 by on an average ~21.6% across various benchmarks compared to RS. Furthermore, models trained on trajectories of GuidedSampling exhibit substantial performance improvements at pass@5 by on an average ~9.7%, compared to models trained on traditional RS.

Empirical evaluations across diverse scenarios across disciplines, including medical diagnosis, physics reasoning, and political decision-making, show that Concept Trees recover semantic hierarchies, disentangle latent concepts, and can be widely applied across multiple domains.

However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user request increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond the final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including previously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity. The most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an agent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is fundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is prohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to assess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the agents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By incorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from preceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and evaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our framework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with multi-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately evaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even with small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the trajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting previously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.<br>

In this work, we challenge this view by establishing a fundamental equivalence between SFT and Inverse Reinforcement Learning. We prove that the SFT objective is a special case of Inverse Q-Learning, which implies that the SFT process does not just learn a policy, but also an implicit, dense, token-level reward model that explains the expert demonstrations. We then show how to recover this dense reward signal directly from the SFT model by formulating a baseline-relative reward function. The availability of such a dense reward model offers numerous benefits, providing granular credit assignment for each token generated. We demonstrate one key application by using these recovered rewards to further improve the policy with reinforcement learning. Our method, Dense-Path REINFORCE, consistently outperforms the original SFT models on instruction-following benchmarks. This work reframes SFT not merely as policy imitation but as a powerful reward learning mechanism, opening new possibilities for leveraging expert demonstrations.<br>

The recently introduced ReasonMap highlights this gap by showing that even advanced MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning in structured and information-rich settings such as transit maps, a task of clear practical and scientific importance. However, standard reinforcement learning (RL) on such tasks is impeded by sparse rewards and unstable optimization. To address this, we first construct ReasonMap-Plus, an extended dataset that introduces dense reward signals through Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, enabling effective cold-start training of fine-grained visual understanding skills. Next, we propose RewardMap, a multi-stage RL framework designed to improve both visual understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. RewardMap incorporates two key designs. First, we introduce a difficulty-aware reward design that incorporates detail rewards, directly tackling the sparse rewards while providing richer supervision. Second, we propose a multi-stage RL scheme that bootstraps training from simple perception to complex reasoning tasks, offering a more effective cold-start strategy than conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experiments on ReasonMap and ReasonMap-Plus demonstrate that each component of RewardMap contributes to consistent performance gains, while their combination yields the best results. Moreover, models trained with RewardMap achieve an average improvement of 3.47% across 6 benchmarks spanning spatial reasoning, fine-grained visual reasoning, and general tasks beyond transit maps, underscoring enhanced visual understanding and reasoning capabilities.<br>

This paper studies how adversarial attacks targeting an ML component can degrade or bypass an entire production-grade malware detection system, performing a case study analysis of Gmail's pipeline where file-type identification relies on a ML model. The malware detection pipeline in use by Gmail contains a machine learning model that routes each potential malware sample to a specialized malware classifier to improve accuracy and performance. This model, called Magika, has been open sourced. By designing adversarial examples that fool Magika, we can cause the production malware service to incorrectly route malware to an unsuitable malware detector thereby increasing our chance of evading detection. Specifically, by changing just 13 bytes of a malware sample, we can successfully evade Magika in 90% of cases and thereby allow us to send malware files over Gmail. We then turn our attention to defenses, and develop an approach to mitigate the severity of these types of attacks. For our defended production model, a highly resourced adversary requires 50 bytes to achieve just a 20% attack success rate.

Large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting such instructions but are prohibitively expensive to deploy at scale, while traditional pipelines of classifiers and extractors remain efficient yet brittle and unable to generalize to new tasks. We introduce Falconer, a collaborative framework that combines the agentic reasoning of LLMs with lightweight proxy models for scalable knowledge mining. In Falconer, LLMs act as planners, decomposing user instructions into executable pipelines, and as annotators, generating supervision to train small proxies. The framework unifies classification and extraction into two atomic operations, get label and get span, enabling a single instruction-following model to replace multiple task-specific components. To evaluate the consistency between proxy models incubated by Falconer and annotations provided by humans and large models, we construct new benchmarks covering both planning and end-to-end execution. Experiments show that Falconer closely matches state-of-the-art LLMs in instruction-following accuracy while reducing inference cost by up to 90% and accelerating large-scale knowledge mining by more than 20x, offering an efficient and scalable foundation for Deep Research.<br>

We interviewed 25 AI developers based in Europe to understand which privacy threats they believe pose the greatest risk to users, developers, and businesses and what protective strategies, if any, would help to mitigate them. We find that there is little consensus among AI developers on the relative ranking of privacy risks. These differences stem from salient reasoning patterns that often relate to human rather than purely technical factors.

It is essential to verify its robustness against semantic transformation perturbations, such as brightness and contrast. However, current certified training and robustness certification methods face the challenge of over-parameterization, which hinders the tightness and scalability due to the over-complicated neural networks. To this end, we first analyze stability and variance of layers and neurons against input perturbation, showing that certifiable robustness can be indicated by a fundamental Unbiased and Smooth Neuron metric (USN). Based on USN, we introduce a novel neural network pruning method that removes neurons with low USN and retains those with high USN, thereby preserving model expressiveness without over-parameterization. To further enhance this pruning process, we propose a new Wasserstein distance loss to ensure that pruned neurons are more concentrated across layers. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on the challenging robust keypoint detection task, which involves realistic brightness and contrast perturbations, demonstrating that our method achieves superior robustness certification performance and efficiency compared to baselines.<br>

Pearl (2000) argues that counterfactuals must be identifiable (i.e., recoverable from the observed data distribution) to justify causal claims. A recent line of work on counterfactual inference shows promising results but lacks identification, undermining the causal validity of its estimates. To address this, we establish a foundation for multivariate counterfactual identification using continuous-time flows, including non-Markovian settings under standard criteria. We characterise the conditions under which flow matching yields a unique, monotone and rank-preserving counterfactual transport map with tools from dynamic optimal transport, ensuring consistent inference. Building on this, we validate the theory in controlled scenarios with counterfactual ground-truth and demonstrate improvements in axiomatic counterfactual soundness on real images.<br>

However, the rotation group SO(3) is a Riemannian manifold. As a result, the distortion caused by non-Euclidean geometric nature introduces difficulties to the incorporation of local constraints, especially for the simultaneous incorporation of multiple local constraints. To address this issue, we propose the Angle-Axis Space-based orientation representation method to solve several orientation learning problems, including orientation adaptation and minimization of angular acceleration. Specifically, we propose a weighted average mechanism in SO(3) based on the angle-axis representation method. Our main idea is to generate multiple trajectories by considering different local constraints at different basepoints. Then these multiple trajectories are fused to generate a smooth trajectory by our proposed weighted average mechanism, achieving the goal to incorporate multiple local constraints simultaneously. Compared with existing solution, ours can address the distortion issue and make the off-theshelf Euclidean learning algorithm be re-applicable in non-Euclidean space. Simulation and Experimental evaluations validate that our solution can not only adapt orientations towards arbitrary desired via-points and cope with angular acceleration constraints, but also incorporate multiple local constraints simultaneously to achieve extra benefits, e.g., achieving smaller acceleration costs.<br>

These artifacts, manifesting as flickering textures and jagged edges, arise from the mismatch between Gaussian primitives and the multi-scale nature of urban geometry. While existing ``divide-and-conquer'' pipelines address scalability, they fail to resolve this fidelity gap. In this paper, we propose PrismGS, a physically-grounded regularization framework that improves the intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D Gaussians. PrismGS integrates two synergistic regularizers. The first is pyramidal multi-scale supervision, which enforces consistency by supervising the rendering against a pre-filtered image pyramid. This compels the model to learn an inherently anti-aliased representation that remains coherent across different viewing scales, directly mitigating flickering textures. This is complemented by an explicit size regularization that imposes a physically-grounded lower bound on the dimensions of the 3D Gaussians. This prevents the formation of degenerate, view-dependent primitives, leading to more stable and plausible geometric surfaces and reducing jagged edges. Our method is plug-and-play and compatible with existing pipelines. Extensive experiments on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D demonstrate that PrismGS achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant PSNR gains around 1.5 dB against CityGaussian, while maintaining its superior quality and robustness under demanding 4K rendering.<br>

Existing research often depends on conspicuous UI overlays, elevated permissions, or impractical threat models, limiting stealth and real-world applicability. In this paper, we present a practical and stealthy one-shot jailbreak attack that leverages in-app prompt injections: malicious applications embed short prompts in UI text that remain inert during human interaction but are revealed when an agent drives the UI via ADB (Android Debug Bridge). Our framework comprises three crucial components: (1) low-privilege perception-chain targeting, which injects payloads into malicious apps as the agent's visual inputs; (2) stealthy user-invisible activation, a touch-based trigger that discriminates agent from human touches using physical touch attributes and exposes the payload only during agent operation; and (3) one-shot prompt efficacy, a heuristic-guided, character-level iterative-deepening search algorithm (HG-IDA*) that performs one-shot, keyword-level detoxification to evade on-device safety filters. We evaluate across multiple LVLM backends, including closed-source services and representative open-source models within three Android applications, and we observe high planning and execution hijack rates in single-shot scenarios (e.g., GPT-4o: 82.5% planning / 75.0% execution).

While prior methods, including prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in modeling step-wise behavior, they primarily learn a population-level policy without conditioning on a user's persona, yielding generic rather than personalized simulations. In this work, we pose a critical question: how can LLM agents better simulate personalized user behavior? We introduce Customer-R1, an RL-based method for personalized, step-wise user behavior simulation in online shopping environments. Our policy is conditioned on an explicit persona, and we optimize next-step rationale and action generation via action correctness reward signals. Experiments on the OPeRA dataset emonstrate that Customer-R1 not only significantly outperforms prompting and SFT-based baselines in next-action prediction tasks, but also better matches users' action distribution, indicating higher fidelity in personalized behavior simulation.<br>

When this process fails, performance in non-English languages deteriorates sharply, limiting the inclusiveness of LLM-based applications. Existing cross-lingual in-context learning (X-ICL) methods primarily leverage monolingual demonstrations, often failing to mitigate this barrier and instead reinforcing it. In this work, we introduce code-switching in-context learning (CSICL), a simple yet effective prompting strategy that progressively transitions from a target language to English within demonstrations and instruction to facilitate their latent reasoning in English. By explicitly scaffolding the reasoning process through controlled code-switching, CSICL acts as an implicit linguistic bridge that enhances cross-lingual alignment and reduces reliance on the translation barrier. We conduct extensive experiments across 4 LLMs, 6 datasets, and 10 languages, spanning both knowledge-intensive and reasoning-oriented domains. Our results demonstrate that CSICL consistently outperforms X-ICL baselines, achieving gains of 3.1%p and 1.9%p in both target and unseen languages, respectively. The improvement is even more pronounced in low-resource settings, with gains of 14.7% in target and 5.3% in unseen languages. These findings establish code-switching as a principled and robust approach for overcoming the translation barrier during inference, moving LLMs toward more equitable and effective multilingual systems.<br>

Recent machine learning models provide high-fidelity MD predictions without the need to repeatedly solve quantum mechanical forces, enabling significant speedups over conventional pipelines. Yet many such methods typically enforce strict equivariance and rely on sequential rollouts, thus limiting their flexibility and simulation efficiency. They are also com- monly single-task, trained on individual molecules and fixed timeframes, which restricts generalization to unseen compounds and extended timesteps. To address these issues, we propose Atomistic Transformer Operator for Molecules (ATOM), a pretrained transformer neural operator for multitask molecular dynamics. ATOM adopts a quasi-equivariant design that requires no explicit molecular graph and employs a temporal attention mechanism, allowing for the accurate parallel decod- ing of multiple future states. To support operator pretraining across chemicals and timescales, we curate TG80, a large, diverse, and numerically stable MD dataset with over 2.5 million femtoseconds of trajectories across 80 compounds. ATOM achieves state-of-the-art performance on established single-task benchmarks, such as MD17, RMD17 and MD22. After multitask pretraining on TG80, ATOM shows exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen molecules across varying time hori- zons.

Prior work often attributes this gap to tokenizer limitations and rasterization ordering. In this work, we identify a core bottleneck from the perspective of generator-tokenizer inconsistency, i.e., the AR-generated tokens may not be well-decoded by the tokenizer. To address this, we propose reAR, a simple training strategy introducing a token-wise regularization objective: when predicting the next token, the causal transformer is also trained to recover the visual embedding of the current token and predict the embedding of the target token under a noisy context. It requires no changes to the tokenizer, generation order, inference pipeline, or external models. Despite its simplicity, reAR substantially improves performance. On ImageNet, it reduces gFID from 3.02 to 1.86 and improves IS to 316.9 using a standard rasterization-based tokenizer. When applied to advanced tokenizers, it achieves a gFID of 1.42 with only 177M parameters, matching the performance with larger state-of-the-art diffusion models (675M).<br>

However, it remains challenging due to limited annotated data, heterogeneous enhancement protocols, and significant domain shifts across scanners and institutions. Traditional image-to-image translation frameworks have made great progress in domain generalization, but their application is not straightforward. For example, Pix2Pix requires image registration, and cycle-GAN cannot be integrated seamlessly into segmentation pipelines. Meanwhile, these methods are originally used to deal with cross-modality scenarios, and often introduce structural distortions and suffer from unstable training, which may pose drawbacks in our single-modality scenario. To address these challenges, we propose CoSSeg-TTA, a compact segmentation framework for the GED4 (Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced hepatobiliary phase MRI) modality built upon nnU-Netv2 and enhanced with a semi-supervised mean teacher scheme to exploit large amounts of unlabeled volumes. A domain adaptation module, incorporating a randomized histogram-based style appearance transfer function and a trainable contrast-aware network, enriches domain diversity and mitigates cross-center variability. Furthermore, a continual test-time adaptation strategy is employed to improve robustness during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms the nnU-Netv2 baseline, achieving superior Dice score and Hausdorff Distance while exhibiting strong generalization to unseen domains under low-annotation conditions.<br>

However, existing methods are largely confined to discriminative models, failing to fully integrate recent breakthroughs in the NLP community concerning Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL is a particularly well-suited paradigm for this task, as it can directly optimize the non-differentiable Spearman ranking metric and guide the reasoning process required by C-STS. However, we find that naively applying listwise RL fails to produce meaningful improvements, as the model is overwhelmed by complex, coarse-grained reward signals. To address this challenge, we introduce PoLi-RL, a novel Point-to-List Reinforcement Learning framework. PoLi-RL employs a two-stage curriculum: it first trains the model with simple pointwise rewards to establish fundamental scoring capabilities, then transitions to a hybrid reward that combines pointwise, pairwise, and listwise objectives to refine the model's ability to discern subtle semantic distinctions. Crucially, we propose an innovative Parallel Slice Ranking Reward (PSRR) mechanism that computes ranking rewards in parallel slices, where each slice comprises same-indexed completions from different samples. This provides a precise, differentiated learning signal for each individual completion, enabling granular credit assignment and effective optimization. On the official C-STS benchmark, PoLi-RL achieves a Spearman correlation coefficient of 48.18, establishing a new SOTA for the cross-encoder architecture. As the first work to successfully apply RL to C-STS, our study introduces a powerful and precise paradigm for training LLMs on complex, ranking-based conditional judgment tasks.<br>

Standard masked diffusion models predict factorized logits over currently masked positions. A number of masked positions are then sampled, however, the factorization approximation means that sampling too many positions in one go leads to poor sample quality. As a result, many simulation steps and therefore neural network function evaluations are required to generate high-quality data. We reduce the computational burden by generating non-factorized predictions over masked positions. This is achieved by modifying the final transformer attention mask from non-causal to causal, enabling draft token generation and parallel validation via a novel, model-integrated speculative sampling mechanism. This results in a non-factorized predictive distribution over masked positions in a single forward pass. We apply our method to GPT2 scale text modelling and protein sequences generation, finding that we can achieve a ~2x reduction in the required number of network forward passes relative to standard masked diffusion models.<br>

A major barrier has been the lack of demographic annotations in web-scale datasets such as LAION-400M. We address this gap by creating person-centric annotations for the full dataset, including over 276 million bounding boxes, perceived gender and race/ethnicity labels, and automatically generated captions. These annotations are produced through validated automatic labeling pipelines combining object detection, multimodal captioning, and finetuned classifiers. Using them, we uncover demographic imbalances and harmful associations, such as the disproportionate linking of men and individuals perceived as Black or Middle Eastern with crime-related and negative content. We also show that 60-70% of gender bias in CLIP and Stable Diffusion can be linearly explained by direct co-occurrences in the data. Our resources establish the first large-scale empirical link between dataset composition and downstream model bias.<br>

To understand how this is achieved, we systematically compare three different feature-fusion designs and fine-tuning recipes.

Forgery Image Detection and Localization (FIDL) thus emerges as essential for maintaining information integrity and societal security. Despite impressive performances by existing domain-specific detection methods, their practical applicability remains limited, primarily due to their narrow specialization, poor cross-domain generalization, and the absence of an integrated adaptive framework. To address these issues, we propose UniShield, the novel multi-agent-based unified system capable of detecting and localizing image forgeries across diverse domains, including image manipulation, document manipulation, DeepFake, and AI-generated images. UniShield innovatively integrates a perception agent with a detection agent. The perception agent intelligently analyzes image features to dynamically select suitable detection models, while the detection agent consolidates various expert detectors into a unified framework and generates interpretable reports. Extensive experiments show that UniShield achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing unified approaches and domain-specific detectors, highlighting its superior practicality, adaptiveness, and scalability.<br>

However, the trajectory planning capability of VLMs in work zones, which often include irregular layouts, temporary traffic control, and dynamically changing geometric structures, is still unexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct the \textit{first} systematic study of VLMs for work zone trajectory planning, revealing that mainstream VLMs fail to generate correct trajectories in $68.0%$ of cases. To better understand these failures, we first identify candidate patterns via subgraph mining and clustering analysis, and then confirm the validity of $8$ common failure patterns through human verification. Building on these findings, we propose REACT-Drive, a trajectory planning framework that integrates VLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, REACT-Drive leverages VLMs to convert prior failure cases into constraint rules and executable trajectory planning code, while RAG retrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation. Experimental results on the ROADWork dataset show that REACT-Drive yields a reduction of around $3\times$ in average displacement error relative to VLM baselines under evaluation with Qwen2.5-VL. In addition, REACT-Drive yields the lowest inference time ($0.58$s) compared with other methods such as fine-tuning ($17.90$s). We further conduct experiments using a real vehicle in 15 work zone scenarios in the physical world, demonstrating the strong practicality of REACT-Drive.<br>

Yet compressing all world knowledge into parameters is unnecessary, as only a fraction is used per prompt, and impractical for edge devices with limited inference-time memory and compute. We address this shortcoming by a memory-augmented architecture and a pretraining strategy aligned with existing hardware paradigms. We introduce small language models that access large hierarchical parametric memory banks encoding world knowledge. During pretraining and inference, we fetch a small, context-dependent memory block and add it to the model. Our pretraining learns to store long-tail world knowledge in the memory parameters, while the small language model acts as an anchor capturing common knowledge and general reasoning abilities. Through trillion-token-scale experiments, we show significant gains: a 160M-parameters model augmented with an 18M-parameters memory fetched from a 4.6B memory bank obtains comparable performance to a regular model with more than 2x the parameters. Through extensive experiments, we study the optimal type and size of parametric memories in transformers, scaling them to over 21B parameters. We find that our proposed hierarchical feed-forward memories work robustly across transformer architectures, whether added during pretraining or post-hoc.<br>

However, the field lacks standardized data resources for fine-tuning and evaluating LLMs as realistic social media agents. We address this gap by introducing SIMPACT, the SIMulation-oriented Persona and Action Capture Toolkit, a privacy respecting framework for constructing behaviorally-grounded social media datasets suitable for training agent models. We formulate next-action prediction as a task for training and evaluating LLM-based agents and introduce metrics at both the cluster and population levels to assess behavioral fidelity and stylistic realism. As a concrete implementation, we release BluePrint, a large-scale dataset built from public Bluesky data focused on political discourse. BluePrint clusters anonymized users into personas of aggregated behaviours, capturing authentic engagement patterns while safeguarding privacy through pseudonymization and removal of personally identifiable information. The dataset includes a sizable action set of 12 social media interaction types (likes, replies, reposts, etc.), each instance tied to the posting activity preceding it. This supports the development of agents that use context-dependence, not only in the language, but also in the interaction behaviours of social media to model social media users. By standardizing data and evaluation protocols, SIMPACT provides a foundation for advancing rigorous, ethically responsible social media simulations.

In this paper, we present JaneEye, an energy-efficient event-based eye-tracking hardware accelerator designed specifically for wearable devices, leveraging sparse, high-temporal-resolution event data. We introduce an ultra-lightweight neural network architecture featuring a novel ConvJANET layer, which simplifies the traditional ConvLSTM by retaining only the forget gate, thereby halving computational complexity without sacrificing temporal modeling capability. Our proposed model achieves high accuracy with a pixel error of 2.45 on the 3ET+ dataset, using only 17.6K parameters, with up to 1250 Hz event frame rate. To further enhance hardware efficiency, we employ custom linear approximations of activation functions (hardsigmoid and hardtanh) and fixed-point quantization. Through software-hardware co-design, our 12-nm ASIC implementation operates at 400 MHz, delivering an end-to-end latency of 0.5 ms (equivalent to 2000 Frames Per Second (FPS)) at an energy efficiency of 18.9 $μ$J/frame.

Yet progress in the open-source community is constrained by the lack of high quality permissively licensed tool-agentic training data. Existing datasets are often limited in diversity, realism, and complexity, particularly regarding multi-tool and multi-turn interactions. To address this gap, we introduce Toucan, the largest publicly available tool-agentic dataset to date, containing 1.5 million trajectories synthesized from nearly 500 real-world Model Context Protocols (MCPs). Unlike prior work, Toucan leverages authentic MCP environments to generate diverse, realistic, and challenging tasks with trajectories involving real tool execution. Our pipeline first produces a broad spectrum of tool-use queries using five distinct models, applies model-based quality filtering, and then generates agentic trajectories with three teacher models using two agentic frameworks. Rigorous rule-based and model-based validation ensures high-quality outputs. We also introduce three extension mechanisms to further diversify tasks and simulate multi-turn conversations. Models fine-tuned on Toucan outperform larger closed-source counterparts on the BFCL V3 benchmark and push the Pareto frontier forward on MCP-Universe Bench.<br>

Unlike conventional "pseudo" discrete diffusion (PDD) methods, ADD reformulates the diffusion input by directly using float-encoded one-hot class data, without relying on diffusing in the continuous latent spaces or masking policies. At its core, a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss is introduced between the diffusion model's outputs and the original one-hot labels. This synergistic design establishes a bridge between discriminative and generative learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ADD not only achieves superior performance on classification tasks compared to the baseline, but also exhibits excellent text generation capabilities on Image captioning.

ATLAS's Production and Distributed Analysis (PanDA) workflow system and the Rucio data management system are each highly optimized for their respective design goals. However, operating them together at global scale exposes systemic inefficiencies, including underutilized resources, redundant or unnecessary transfers, and altered error distributions. Moreover, PanDA and Rucio currently lack shared performance awareness and coordinated, adaptive strategies. This work charts a path toward co-optimizing the two systems by diagnosing data-management pitfalls and prioritizing end-to-end improvements. With the observation of spatially and temporally imbalanced transfer activities, we develop a metadata-matching algorithm that links PanDA jobs and Rucio datasets at the file level, yielding a complete, fine-grained view of data access and movement. Using this linkage, we identify anomalous transfer patterns that violate PanDA's data-centric job-allocation principle. We then outline mitigation strategies for these patterns and highlight opportunities for tighter PanDA-Rucio coordination to improve resource utilization, reduce unnecessary data movement, and enhance overall system resilience.<br>

However, existing simulators suffer from limited scalability, hardwired algorithms, lack of real-time monitoring, and inability to generate datasets suitable for modern machine learning approaches. We present CGSim, a simulation framework for large-scale distributed computing environments that addresses these limitations. Built upon the validated SimGrid simulation framework, CGSim provides high-level abstractions for modeling heterogeneous grid environments while maintaining accuracy and scalability. Key features include a modular plugin mechanism for testing custom workflow scheduling and data movement policies, interactive real-time visualization dashboards, and automatic generation of event-level datasets suitable for AI-assisted performance modeling. We demonstrate CGSim's capabilities through a comprehensive evaluation using production ATLAS PanDA workloads, showing significant calibration accuracy improvements across WLCG computing sites. Scalability experiments show near-linear scaling for multi-site simulations, with distributed workloads achieving 6x better performance compared to single-site execution. The framework enables researchers to simulate WLCG-scale infrastructures with hundreds of sites and thousands of concurrent jobs within practical time budget constraints on commodity hardware.<br>

It operates by linearly combining conditional and unconditional score estimates using a guidance weight $ω$. While a large, static weight can markedly improve visual results, this often comes at the cost of poorer distributional alignment. In order to better approximate the target conditional distribution, we instead learn guidance weights $ω_{c,(s,t)}$, which are continuous functions of the conditioning $c$, the time $t$ from which we denoise, and the time $s$ towards which we denoise. We achieve this by minimizing the distributional mismatch between noised samples from the true conditional distribution and samples from the guided diffusion process. We extend our framework to reward guided sampling, enabling the model to target distributions tilted by a reward function $R(x_0,c)$, defined on clean data and a conditioning $c$. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology on low-dimensional toy examples and high-dimensional image settings, where we observe improvements in Fréchet inception distance (FID) for image generation. In text-to-image applications, we observe that employing a reward function given by the CLIP score leads to guidance weights that improve image-prompt alignment.<br>

Existing works typically rely on complicated, task-specific fine-tuning, which limits their generalizability and increases model complexity. In this work, we propose an effective, training-free framework that uses an MLLM's intrinsic uncertainty as a proactive guidance signal. Our core insight is that a model's output entropy decreases when presented with relevant visual information. We introduce a unified mechanism that scores candidate visual inputs by response uncertainty, enabling the model to autonomously focus on the most salient data. We apply this simple principle to three complex visual tasks: Visual Search, Long Video Understanding, and Temporal Grounding, allowing off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve performance competitive with specialized, fine-tuned methods. Our work validates that harnessing intrinsic uncertainty is a powerful, general strategy for enhancing fine-grained multimodal performance.<br>

Current video benchmarks predominantly target general scenarios where perception/recognition is heavily relied on, while with relatively simple reasoning tasks, leading to saturation and thus failing to effectively evaluate advanced multimodal cognitive skills. To address this critical gap, we introduce SciVideoBench, a rigorous benchmark specifically designed to assess advanced video reasoning in scientific contexts. SciVideoBench consists of 1,000 carefully crafted multiple-choice questions derived from cutting-edge scientific experimental videos spanning over 25 specialized academic subjects and verified by a semi-automatic system. Each question demands sophisticated domain-specific knowledge, precise spatiotemporal perception, and intricate logical reasoning, effectively challenging models' higher-order cognitive abilities. Our evaluation highlights significant performance deficits in state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LMMs, including Gemini 2.5 Pro and Qwen2.5-VL, indicating substantial room for advancement in video reasoning capabilities. Detailed analyses of critical factors such as reasoning complexity and visual grounding provide valuable insights and clear direction for future developments in LMMs, driving the evolution of truly capable multimodal AI co-scientists.

The complex, contact-rich dynamics of dexterous manipulation create a "reality gap" that has limited prior work to constrained scenarios involving simple geometries, limited object sizes and aspect ratios, constrained wrist poses, or customized hands. We address this sim-to-real challenge with a novel framework that enables a single policy, trained in simulation, to generalize to a wide variety of objects and conditions in the real world. The core of our method is a joint-wise dynamics model that learns to bridge the reality gap by effectively fitting limited amount of real-world collected data and then adapting the sim policy's actions accordingly. The model is highly data-efficient and generalizable across different whole-hand interaction distributions by factorizing dynamics across joints, compressing system-wide influences into low-dimensional variables, and learning each joint's evolution from its own dynamic profile, implicitly capturing these net effects. We pair this with a fully autonomous data collection strategy that gathers diverse, real-world interaction data with minimal human intervention. Our complete pipeline demonstrates unprecedented generality: a single policy successfully rotates challenging objects with complex shapes (e.g., animals), high aspect ratios (up to 5.33), and small sizes, all while handling diverse wrist orientations and rotation axes. Comprehensive real-world evaluations and a teleoperation application for complex tasks validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. Website: https://meowuu7.github.io/DexNDM/<br>

A popular approach, Learning to Defer (LtD), allows a Machine Learning (ML) model to pass difficult cases to a human expert. However, LtD treats humans and ML models as mutually exclusive decision-makers, restricting the expert contribution to mere predictions. To address this limitation, we propose Learning to Ask (LtA), a new framework that handles both when and how to incorporate expert input in an ML model. LtA is based on a two-part architecture: a standard ML model and an enriched model trained with additional expert human feedback, with a formally optimal strategy for selecting when to query the enriched model. We provide two practical implementations of LtA: a sequential approach, which trains the models in stages, and a joint approach, which optimises them simultaneously. For the latter, we design surrogate losses with realisable-consistency guarantees. Our experiments with synthetic and real expert data demonstrate that LtA provides a more flexible and powerful foundation for effective human-AI collaboration.<br>

Using a self-play setup across three diverse dialogue games, we analyse trade-offs between performance and cost, the language consistency of reasoning processes, and the nature of strategic adaptation exhibited by models. Our findings show that enabling reasoning-that is, scaling test time compute-significantly improves negotiation outcomes by enhancing collaboration and helping models overcome task complexities, but comes at a substantial computational cost: reasoning improves GPT-5's performance by 31.4 % while increasing its cost by nearly 400 %. Most critically, we uncover a significant multilingual reasoning distinction: open-weight models consistently switch to English for their internal reasoning steps, even when negotiating in German or Italian (and thus possibly impacting potential explainability gains through the disclosure of reasoning traces), while leading commercial models maintain language consistency between their reasoning and final output.<br>

However, vehicle mobility leads to spatio-temporal unpredictability of resource demands, while real-time double auctions incur significant latency. To address these challenges, we propose a look-ahead contract-based auction framework that shifts decision-making from runtime to planning time. Our approach establishes N-step service contracts between edge servers (ESs) using demand forecasts and modified double auctions. The system operates in two stages: first, an LSTM-based prediction module forecasts multi-slot resource needs and determines ES roles (buyer or seller), after which a pre-double auction generates contracts specifying resource quantities, prices, and penalties. Second, these contracts are enforced in real time without rerunning auctions. The framework incorporates energy costs, transmission overhead, and contract breach risks into utility models, ensuring truthful, rational, and energy-efficient trading. Experiments on real-world (UTD19) and synthetic traces demonstrate that our method improves time efficiency, energy use, and social welfare compared with existing baselines.<br>

Given a Markov decision process (MDP) representing the sequential decision-making task, an LLM policy, and a safety requirement expressed as a PCTL formula, our approach incrementally constructs only the reachable portion of the MDP guided by the LLM's chosen actions. Each state is encoded as a natural language prompt, the LLM's response is parsed into an action, and reachable successor states by the policy are expanded. The resulting formal model is checked with Storm to determine whether the policy satisfies the specified safety property. In experiments on standard grid world benchmarks, we show that open source LLMs accessed via Ollama can be verified when deterministically seeded, but generally underperform deep reinforcement learning baselines.

While flow matching offers a natural framework for this task, its use has thus far primarily focused on the noise-to-data setting, while its application in the general distribution-to-distribution setting is underexplored. We find that in the latter case, where the source is also a data distribution to be learned from limited samples, standard flow matching fails due to sparse supervision. To address this, we propose a simple and computationally efficient method that injects stochasticity into the training process by perturbing source samples and flow interpolants. On five diverse imaging tasks spanning biology, radiology, and astronomy, our method significantly improves generation quality, outperforming existing baselines by an average of 9 FID points.

Among their most critical applications is operating system (OS) control. As CUAs in the OS domain become increasingly embedded in daily operations, it is imperative to examine their real-world security implications, specifically whether CUAs can be misused to perform realistic, security-relevant attacks. Existing works exhibit four major limitations: Missing attacker-knowledge model on tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP), Incomplete coverage for end-to-end kill chains, unrealistic environment without multi-host and encrypted user credentials, and unreliable judgment dependent on LLM-as-a-Judge. To address these gaps, we propose AdvCUA, the first benchmark aligned with real-world TTPs in MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise Matrix, which comprises 140 tasks, including 40 direct malicious tasks, 74 TTP-based malicious tasks, and 26 end-to-end kill chains, systematically evaluates CUAs under a realistic enterprise OS security threat in a multi-host environment sandbox by hard-coded evaluation. We evaluate the existing five mainstream CUAs, including ReAct, AutoGPT, Gemini CLI, Cursor CLI, and Cursor IDE based on 8 foundation LLMs. The results demonstrate that current frontier CUAs do not adequately cover OS security-centric threats. These capabilities of CUAs reduce dependence on custom malware and deep domain expertise, enabling even inexperienced attackers to mount complex enterprise intrusions, which raises social concern about the responsibility and security of CUAs.<br>

LLM fingerprinting has emerged as a key technique to address this, which aims to verify a model's origin by extracting an intrinsic, unique signature (a "fingerprint") and comparing it to that of a source model to identify illicit copies. However, existing black-box fingerprinting methods often fail to generate distinctive LLM fingerprints. This ineffectiveness arises because black-box methods typically rely on model outputs, which lose critical information about the model's unique parameters due to the usage of non-linear functions. To address this, we first leverage Fisher Information Theory to formally demonstrate that the gradient of the model's input is a more informative feature for fingerprinting than the output. Based on this insight, we propose ZeroPrint, a novel method that approximates these information-rich gradients in a black-box setting using zeroth-order estimation. ZeroPrint overcomes the challenge of applying this to discrete text by simulating input perturbations via semantic-preserving word substitutions. This operation allows ZeroPrint to estimate the model's Jacobian matrix as a unique fingerprint. Experiments on the standard benchmark show ZeroPrint achieves a state-of-the-art effectiveness and robustness, significantly outperforming existing black-box methods.<br>

To bridge this gap, we introduce Everyday Multimodal and Multilingual QA (EverydayMMQA), a framework for creating large-scale, culturally-grounded datasets for spoken and visual question answering (SVQA). Using this framework, we developed OASIS, a multimodal dataset integrating speech, images, and text. With over ~0.92M images and 14.8M QA pairs, OASIS contains 3.7M spoken questions, enabling four unique input combinations: speech-only, text-only, speech+image, and text+image. Focused on English and Arabic varieties, 18 countries, the dataset content is curated to reflect diverse, real-world situations. OASIS tests models on tasks beyond object recognition that involve pragmatic, commonsense, and culturally aware reasoning. We benchmarked four closed-source models, three open-source models, and one fine-tuned model. EverydayMMQA and OASIS together provide a benchmark and training dataset for building multimodal LLMs for a comprehensive set of everyday tasks within cultural contexts.

However, their adoption in randomized neural networks (RNNs) has been limited due to the lack of effective methods for transforming real-valued tabular datasets into complex-valued representations. To address this limitation, we propose two methods for generating complex-valued representations from real-valued datasets: a natural transformation and an autoencoder-driven method. Building on these mechanisms, we propose RVFL-X, a complex-valued extension of the random vector functional link (RVFL) network. RVFL-X integrates complex transformations into real-valued datasets while maintaining the simplicity and efficiency of the original RVFL architecture. By leveraging complex components such as input, weights, and activation functions, RVFL-X processes complex representations and produces real-valued outputs. Comprehensive evaluations on 80 real-valued UCI datasets demonstrate that RVFL-X consistently outperforms both the original RVFL and state-of-the-art (SOTA) RNN variants, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness across diverse application domains.<br>

However, while exhibiting a high degree of structural organization, movie scripts demand an additional layer of nuanced storytelling and emotional depth-the 'soul' of compelling cinema-that LLMs often fail to capture. To investigate this deficiency, we first curated CML-Dataset, a dataset comprising (summary, content) pairs for Cinematic Markup Language (CML), where 'content' consists of segments from esteemed, high-quality movie scripts and 'summary' is a concise description of the content. Through an in-depth analysis of the intrinsic multi-shot continuity and narrative structures within these authentic scripts, we identified three pivotal dimensions for quality assessment: Dialogue Coherence (DC), Character Consistency (CC), and Plot Reasonableness (PR). Informed by these findings, we propose the CML-Bench, featuring quantitative metrics across these dimensions. CML-Bench effectively assigns high scores to well-crafted, human-written scripts while concurrently pinpointing the weaknesses in screenplays generated by LLMs. To further validate our benchmark, we introduce CML-Instruction, a prompting strategy with detailed instructions on character dialogue and event logic, to guide LLMs to generate more structured and cinematically sound scripts. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our benchmark and demonstrate that LLMs guided by CML-Instruction generate higher-quality screenplays, with results aligned with human preferences.<br>

This fragmentation limits their evolution into foundation models that can learn and reason across the full spectrum of biomedical data. We propose MeDiM, the first medical discrete diffusion model that learns shared distributions across modalities without modality-specific components. MeDiM unifies multiple generative tasks: translating between images and text, and jointly producing image-report pairs across domains in response to prompts. Built on a discrete diffusion framework, MeDiM bridges vision and language representations through a shared probabilistic space. To enable unified and flexible medical generation, we employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as the diffusion backbone, leveraging its prior knowledge and cross-modal reasoning. Two key designs are introduced: (1) removing the causal attention mask for bidirectional context, and (2) injecting continuous timestep embeddings for diffusion awareness. Experiments demonstrate high-fidelity medical generation (FID 16.60 on MIMIC-CXR and FID 24.19 on PathGen) and accurate report generation (METEOR 0.2650 and 0.2580). Jointly generated image-report pairs further enhance downstream performance (plus6.43 percent BLEU-1, plus18.57 percent BLEU-2, plus31.58 percent BLEU-3, plus4.80 percent METEOR), showing that MeDiM supports coherent and clinically grounded multimodal outputs.<br>

In this work, we investigate why safety alignment fails in reasoning models through a mechanistic interpretability lens. Using a linear probing approach to trace refusal intentions across token positions, we discover a striking phenomenon termed as \textbf{refusal cliff}: many poorly-aligned reasoning models correctly identify harmful prompts and maintain strong refusal intentions during their thinking process, but experience a sharp drop in refusal scores at the final tokens before output generation. This suggests that these models are not inherently unsafe; rather, their refusal intentions are systematically suppressed. Through causal intervention analysis, we identify a sparse set of attention heads that negatively contribute to refusal behavior. Ablating just 3\% of these heads can reduce attack success rates below 10\%. Building on these mechanistic insights, we propose \textbf{Cliff-as-a-Judge}, a novel data selection method that identifies training examples exhibiting the largest refusal cliff to efficiently repair reasoning models' safety alignment. This approach achieves comparable safety improvements using only 1.7\% of the vanilla safety training data, demonstrating a less-is-more effect in safety alignment.<br>

Their distinctive decoding mechanism enables faster inference speed and strong performance in code generation and mathematical tasks. In this work, we show that the decoding mechanism of dLLMs not only enhances model utility but also can be used as a powerful tool for model attribution. A key challenge in this problem lies in the diversity of attribution scenarios, including distinguishing between different models as well as between different checkpoints or backups of the same model. To ensure broad applicability, we identify two fundamental problems: what information to extract from the decoding trajectory, and how to utilize it effectively. We first observe that relying directly on per-step model confidence yields poor performance. This is mainly due to the bidirectional decoding nature of dLLMs: each newly decoded token influences the confidence of other decoded tokens, making model confidence highly redundant and washing out structural signal regarding decoding order or dependencies. To overcome this, we propose a novel information extraction scheme called the Directed Decoding Map (DDM), which captures structural relationships between decoding steps and better reveals model-specific behaviors. Furthermore, to make full use of the extracted structural information during attribution, we propose Gaussian-Trajectory Attribution (GTA), where we fit a cell-wise Gaussian distribution at each decoding position for each target model, and define the likelihood of a trajectory as the attribution score: if a trajectory exhibits higher log-likelihood under the distribution of a specific model, it is more likely to have been generated by that model. Extensive experiments under different settings validate the utility of our methods.<br>

In this paper, we decompose the process of empirical software fault study into three key phases: (1) research objective definition, (2) data preparation, and (3) fault analysis, and we conduct an initial exploration study of applying Large Language Models (LLMs) for fault analysis of open-source software.

CRISP was comprehensively evaluated on more than 15,000 intraoperative slides across nearly 100 retrospective diagnostic tasks, including benign-malignant discrimination, key intraoperative decision-making, and pan-cancer detection, etc. The model demonstrated robust generalization across diverse institutions, tumor types, and anatomical sites-including previously unseen sites and rare cancers. In a prospective cohort of over 2,000 patients, CRISP sustained high diagnostic accuracy under real-world conditions, directly informing surgical decisions in 92.6% of cases. Human-AI collaboration further reduced diagnostic workload by 35%, avoided 105 ancillary tests and enhanced detection of micrometastases with 87.5% accuracy.

OWPuzzs are implied by almost all quantum cryptographic primitives, and imply several important applications such as non-interactive commitments and multi-party computations. A significant goal in the field of quantum cryptography is to base OWPuzzs on plausible assumptions that will not imply OWFs. In this paper, we base OWPuzzs on hardness of non-collapsing measurements. To that end, we introduce a new complexity class, $\mathbf{SampPDQP}$, which is a sampling version of the decision class $\mathbf{PDQP}$ introduced in [Aaronson, Bouland, Fitzsimons, and Lee, ITCS 2016]. We show that if $\mathbf{SampPDQP}$ is hard on average for quantum polynomial time, then OWPuzzs exist. $\mathbf{SampPDQP}$ is the class of sampling problems that can be solved by a classical polynomial-time algorithm that can make a single query to a non-collapsing measurement oracle, which is a ''magical'' oracle that can sample measurement results on quantum states without collapsing the states. Such non-collapsing measurements are highly unphysical operations that should be hard to realize in quantum polynomial-time. We also study upperbounds of the hardness of $\mathbf{SampPDQP}$. We introduce a new primitive, distributional collision-resistant puzzles (dCRPuzzs), which are a natural quantum analogue of distributional collision-resistant hashing [Dubrov and Ishai, STOC 2006]. We show that dCRPuzzs imply average-case hardness of $\mathbf{SampPDQP}$ (and therefore OWPuzzs as well). We also show that two-message honest-statistically-hiding commitments with classical communication and one-shot signatures [Amos, Georgiou, Kiayias, Zhandry, STOC 2020] imply dCRPuzzs.<br>

We propose Drax, a discrete flow matching framework for ASR that enables efficient parallel decoding. To better align training with inference, we construct an audio-conditioned probability path that guides the model through trajectories resembling likely intermediate inference errors, rather than direct random noise to target transitions. Our theoretical analysis links the generalization gap to divergences between training and inference occupancies, controlled by cumulative velocity errors, thereby motivating our design choice. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that our approach attains recognition accuracy on par with state-of-the-art speech models while offering improved accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, highlighting discrete flow matching as a promising direction for advancing NAR ASR.<br>

In this paper, we introduce a new concept, proofs of quantum memory (PoQM). A PoQM is an interactive protocol between a classical probabilistic polynomial-time (PPT) verifier and a quantum polynomial-time (QPT) prover over a classical channel where the verifier can verify that the prover has possessed a quantum memory with a certain number of qubits during a specified period of time. PoQM generalize the notion of proofs of quantumness (PoQ) [Brakerski, Christiano, Mahadev, Vazirani, and Vidick, JACM 2021]. Our main contributions are a formal definition of PoQM and its constructions based on hardness of LWE. Specifically, we give two constructions of PoQM. The first is of a four-round and has negligible soundness error under subexponential-hardness of LWE. The second is of a polynomial-round and has inverse-polynomial soundness error under polynomial-hardness of LWE. As a lowerbound of PoQM, we also show that PoQM imply one-way puzzles. Moreover, a certain restricted version of PoQM implies quantum computation classical communication (QCCC) key exchange.<br>

Current detectors primarily rely on pattern-based features to separate fake news videos from real ones. However, limited and less diversified training data lead to biased patterns and hinder their performance. This weakness stems from the complex many-to-many relationships between video material segments and fabricated news events in real-world scenarios: a single video clip can be utilized in multiple ways to create different fake narratives, while a single fabricated event often combines multiple distinct video segments. However, existing datasets do not adequately reflect such relationships due to the difficulty of collecting and annotating large-scale real-world data, resulting in sparse coverage and non-comprehensive learning of the characteristics of potential fake news video creation. To address this issue, we propose a data augmentation framework, AgentAug, that generates diverse fake news videos by simulating typical creative processes. AgentAug implements multiple LLM-driven pipelines of four fabrication categories for news video creation, combined with an active learning strategy based on uncertainty sampling to select the potentially useful augmented samples during training. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that AgentAug consistently improves the performance of short video fake news detectors.<br>

Yet, the distribution of biomedical captions from large-scale open source literature reveals that a huge portion of captions far exceed 77 tokens. To this end, we investigate the impact of pretraining on long-format biomedical captions by extending the context length of text encoders in VLMs. We find that longer context (thus, enabling additional supervision provided in long-format captions) correlates with better retrieval and classification performance. Given this finding, we introduce BIOMEDICA-LongCAP, a dataset of 1M image-caption pairs enriched with context-aware descriptions from full-text articles, providing longer and additional textual supervision. Using BIOMEDICA-LongCAP, we train BMC-LongCLIP, a long-context biomedical VLM with a text encoder supporting windows of up to 512 tokens. Our model extends context capacity by 6.6x, reducing token waste from 55% to just 2.2%. On long-caption retrieval benchmarks, BMC-LongCLIP achieves up to +30% absolute gains in Recall@1 and +2% average improvements in classification, while also converging faster than short-context. Our results demonstrate that long-context modeling is a promising direction for advancing biomedical VLMs.<br>

The dynamics of those agents strongly depends on their tasks, roles, or observable labels. Class-conditioned motion prediction is thus an appealing way to reduce forecast uncertainty and get more accurate predictions for heterogeneous agents. However, this is hardly explored in the prior art, especially for mobile robots and in limited data applications. In this paper, we analyse different class-conditioned trajectory prediction methods on two datasets. We propose a set of conditional pattern-based and efficient deep learning-based baselines, and evaluate their performance on robotics and outdoors datasets (THÖR-MAGNI and Stanford Drone Dataset). Our experiments show that all methods improve accuracy in most of the settings when considering class labels. More importantly, we observe that there are significant differences when learning from imbalanced datasets, or in new environments where sufficient data is not available. In particular, we find that deep learning methods perform better on balanced datasets, but in applications with limited data, e.g., cold start of a robot in a new environment, or imbalanced classes, pattern-based methods may be preferable.<br>

However, MIS robots have long kinematic chains and partial visibility of their degrees of freedom in the camera, which introduces challenges for conventional camera-to-robot calibration methods that assume stiff robots with good visibility. Previous works have investigated both keypoint-based and rendering-based approaches to address this challenge in real-world conditions; however, they often struggle with consistent feature detection or have long inference times, neither of which are ideal for online robot control. In this work, we propose a novel framework that unifies the detection of geometric primitives (keypoints and shaft edges) through a shared encoding, enabling efficient pose estimation via projection geometry. This architecture detects both keypoints and edges in a single inference and is trained on large-scale synthetic data with projective labeling. This method is evaluated across both feature detection and pose estimation, with qualitative and quantitative results demonstrating fast performance and state-of-the-art accuracy in challenging surgical environments.<br>
